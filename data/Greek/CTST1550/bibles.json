Stephani: Geneva, Switzerland, 1550. OCLC 557722140. Robert Estienne (known as Stephanus) (1503-1559) edited and printed four editions of the Textus Receptus from 1546 to 1551. His third edition of 1550 was the first to have a critical apparatus, with references to the Complutensian Polyglot and fifteen additional Greek manuscripts. The fourth edition of 1551 had the same Greek text as the third, but is especially noteworthy for its division of the NT books into chapters and verses, a system still in use today. Stephanus used 15 other Greek Byzantine manuscripts along with the Complutensian Polyglot, and even two other Alexandrian Codices, who were given to him “by friends in Italy”. The result, the Byzantine manuscripts were in perfect harmony with Erasmus’ Greek text! Therefore, the work of Stephanus in 1550 standardized the Erasmus Greek New Testament as the “Received Text” for the next 500 years. This shows the hand of God carefully preserving His Word through the centuries awaiting the unveiling in the Reformation of the sixteenth century. The third printing, in1550, was a beautiful masterpiece, printed with a magnificent Greek font and a large folio size. This was not only the most handsome edition, but also the most important of his texts because it was the first to have a textual apparatus listing the readings of the 15 Greek manuscripts he used.  Soon after the publication of the folio edition, because of the continuing threat of persecution, Stephanus secretly fled Paris for Geneva to meet with John Calvin and the friends of the Reformation. In Geneva, Stephanus now openly supported the Protestant movement and set up his press in Switzerland, free to continue printing for the Reformation. It was in Geneva where he published his fourth edition of his Greek Testament, in 1551, the first Bible to have verse divisions in it, and the bases for the soon to come Geneva Bible of 1557. Robert Stephanus, who was friends with Reformer John Calvin, in 1559 from Geneva, printed Calvin’s “Institutes of Christian Religion”, a work of Protestant systematic theology, much like Melanchthon’s Loci Communes. The third and fourth editions of Stephanus’ Greek New Testament standardized the Erasmus text and became the foundation for all future Bibles up to 1881. Stephanus’ work assured the dominance of the text begun by Erasmus, which was the foundation for all the translations in the common tongue of the Reformation. Textual criticism, namely the 1550 Greek Testament of Stephanus, has only strengthened the purity of the Word of God, proving its harmony and authentication of One Author, the Holy Spirit.","copyRight":"Public Domain","additionalInformation":null},"books":[{"bookNo":1,"shortName":"Gen","longName":"Genesis","englishName":"Genesis","chapterCount":28},{"bookNo":2,"shortName":"Exo","longName":"Exodus","englishName":"Exodus","chapterCount":16},{"bookNo":3,"shortName":"Lev","longName":"Leviticus","englishName":"Leviticus","chapterCount":24},{"bookNo":4,"shortName":"Num","longName":"Numbers","englishName":"Numbers","chapterCount":21},{"bookNo":5,"shortName":"Deu","longName":"Deuteronomy","englishName":"Deuteronomy","chapterCount":28},{"bookNo":6,"shortName":"Jos","longName":"Joshua","englishName":"Joshua","chapterCount":16},{"bookNo":7,"shortName":"Jdg","longName":"Judges","englishName":"Judges","chapterCount":16},{"bookNo":8,"shortName":"Rth","longName":"Ruth","englishName":"Ruth","chapterCount":13},{"bookNo":9,"shortName":"1Sa","longName":"1 Samuel","englishName":"1 Samuel","chapterCount":6},{"bookNo":10,"shortName":"2Sa","longName":"2 Samuel","englishName":"2 Samuel","chapterCount":6},{"bookNo":11,"shortName":"1Ki","longName":"1 Kings","englishName":"1 Kings","chapterCount":4},{"bookNo":12,"shortName":"2Ki","longName":"2 Kings","englishName":"2 Kings","chapterCount":4},{"bookNo":13,"shortName":"1Ch","longName":"1 Chronicles","englishName":"1 Chronicles","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":14,"shortName":"2Ch","longName":"2 Chronicles","englishName":"2 Chronicles","chapterCount":3},{"bookNo":15,"shortName":"Ezr","longName":"Ezra","englishName":"Ezra","chapterCount":6},{"bookNo":16,"shortName":"Neh","longName":"Nehemiah","englishName":"Nehemiah","chapterCount":4},{"bookNo":17,"shortName":"Est","longName":"Esther","englishName":"Esther","chapterCount":3},{"bookNo":18,"shortName":"Job","longName":"Job","englishName":"Job","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":19,"shortName":"Psa","longName":"Psalms","englishName":"Psalms","chapterCount":13},{"bookNo":20,"shortName":"Pro","longName":"Proverbs","englishName":"Proverbs","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":21,"shortName":"Ecc","longName":"Ecclesiastes","englishName":"Ecclesiastes","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":22,"shortName":"Son","longName":"Song of Songs","englishName":"Song of Songs","chapterCount":3},{"bookNo":23,"shortName":"Isa","longName":"Isaiah","englishName":"Isaiah","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":24,"shortName":"Jer","longName":"Jeremiah","englishName":"Jeremiah","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":25,"shortName":"Lam","longName":"Lamentations","englishName":"Lamentations","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":26,"shortName":"Eze","longName":"Ezekiel","englishName":"Ezekiel","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":27,"shortName":"Dan","longName":"Daniel","englishName":"Daniel","chapterCount":22}]}]}
