For the upper piazza was taken from the building and out of that which was a piazza below was made a platform. So there was a piazza and a platform; and this was the case with two of the piazzas,"},{"number":6,"verse":"for there were three one above another.; But they had not pillars like the pillars of the outer piazzas; therefore the upper chambers were straightened more than the middle and the middle more than those on the ground."},{"number":7,"verse":"And they had light from without in the same manner as the chambers of the outer court, in front of these chambers on the north, the extent being fifty cubits."},{"number":8,"verse":"For the chambers which looked into the outer court were fifty cubits deep and were the fore front of these.

Because this is a holy place,"},{"number":14,"verse":"none but the priests are to go in there. That they who offer up the offerings may be continually holy, and that none may touch the garments in which they minister because they are holy, the priests must not go out from the sanctuary into the outer court.
