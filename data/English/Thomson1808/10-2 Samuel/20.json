Now Joab had a military robe girded on for his dress, and over it he was girt with a sword on his thigh in its sheath, and the sword dropped out."},{"number":9,"verse":"But as it dropped out and fell, therefore when Joab said to Amessai, art thou well my brother? and with his right hand took hold of Amessai's beard to kiss it,"},{"number":10,"verse":"Amessai did not attend to the sword which was in Joab's hand.
