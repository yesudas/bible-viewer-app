You will be indeed talking to the air."},{"number":10,"verse":"Let there be ever so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them without signification,"},{"number":11,"verse":"if I do not know the meaning of the sound I shall be to the speaker a barbarian, and he who speaketh will be the same to me."},{"number":12,"verse":"Such also is the case with you. Since you then are ambitious of spiritual gifts, seek to abound in such as tend to the improvement of the congregation."},{"number":13,"verse":"Let him therefore who speaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret."},{"number":14,"verse":"For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful."},{"number":15,"verse":"What then is to be done? I am to pray with the spirit and to pray with the understanding also. I am to sing with the spirit, and to sing with the understanding also."},{"number":16,"verse":"Otherwise if thou bless with the spirit, how can he who occupieth the place of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving thanks, when he knoweth not what thou sayest?"},{"number":17,"verse":"Thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified."},{"number":18,"verse":"I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all;"},{"number":19,"verse":"but in a congregation I would rather speak five words with my understanding that I may instruct others, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."},{"number":20,"verse":"Brethren, be not children in your understandings; but be infants in malice; and in your understandings full grown men."},{"number":21,"verse":"It is written in the law, \"By men of strange tongues and with strange lips I will speak to this people; yet for all this they will not hearken to me, saith the Lord.\""},{"number":22,"verse":"So that these strange tongues are for a sign, not for them who believe; but for unbelievers. But prophesying is not for unbelievers, but for them who believe."},{"number":23,"verse":"If therefore the whole congregation assemble and all speak with unknown tongues, and there should come in any uninstructed persons or unbelievers, would they not say that you are raving?"},{"number":24,"verse":"But if all prophesy, and any unbeliever or uninstructed person come in, he is convicted by all; examined by all;"},{"number":25,"verse":"and thus the secrets of his heart are laid open, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is indeed among you."},{"number":26,"verse":"What then, brethren, is to be done? When you come together every one of you hath a psalm; hath a doctrine; hath a strange tongue; hath a revelation; hath an interpretation; let all be for edification;"},{"number":27,"verse":"and if any one speak in an unknown tongue, let him speak as by two, or at the most three; and in parts, and let one interpret:"},{"number":28,"verse":"but if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in a congregation, and speak to himself and to God."},{"number":29,"verse":"And let two or three prophets speak, and let the rest deliberate."},{"number":30,"verse":"And if a revelation be made to another who is sitting, let the first have become silent."},{"number":31,"verse":"For you can all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn, and all be comforted,"},{"number":32,"verse":"And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets."},{"number":33,"verse":"For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace, As in all the congregations of the saints"},{"number":34,"verse":"let your women be silent in these congregations: for they are not permitted to talk, but to be in subjection, as the law also saith:"},{"number":35,"verse":"And if they wish to learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home.
