One came every three years to the king from Tharsis, with gold and silver and stones wrought in a lathe or hewn with a chisel. This was an arrangement which king Solomon had made to provide for building the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and the wall of Jerusalem, and the citadel; and to fortify the city of David and Assur and Magdol and Gazer and upper Baithoron and Jethermath and all the chariot cities and all the cities for the cavalry, and for all the works which he purposed to construct in Jerusalem and in all the country, in order to keep in subjection all the remains of the Chettites and the Amorites and the Pherezites and the Chananites and the Evites and the Jebusites and the Gergasites, who were not of the children of Israel; The children of them who had been left with him in the land, whom the Israelites could not wholly extirpate, these Solomon subjected to a tribute which continueth to this day. But from the children of Israel he exacted nothing; because they were his warriors and his servants, his chiefs and his nobles, his charioteers and his horsemen."},{"number":23,"verse":"So Solomon was magnified above all the kings of the earth in riches and understanding."},{"number":24,"verse":"And all the kings of the land sought an interview with Solomon, to hear his wisdom which the Lord put in his heart."},{"number":25,"verse":"And they brought, every one as gifts, vessels of gold and raiment and stacte and spices and horses and mules and this every year."},{"number":26,"verse":"And Solomon had four thousand mares for chariots and twelve thousand cavalry.
