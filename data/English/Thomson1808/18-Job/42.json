And it is written that he will rise again with them whom the Lord raiseth up. This is translated out of a book in the Syrian language: For he dwelt in the land of Ausitis, on the confines of Idumea and Arabia. His first name was Jobab, and having married an Arabian woman, he had by her a son whose name was Ennon. Now he himself was a son of father Zare, one of the sons of Esau, and his motherâ€™s name was Bosorra: so that he was the fifth in descent from Abraham. Now these were the kings who reigned in Edom, over which country he also bore rule. The first was Balak, the son of Beor, and the name of his city was Dannaba. And after Balak, Jobab, who is called Job; and after him, Asom who was general from the region of Thaimanitis; and after him, Adad, son of Barad, who smote Madiam in the plain of Moab; and the name of his city was Gethaim. And the friends who came to Job were Eliphaz, of the sons of Esau, the king of the Thaimanites; Baldad, the sovereign of the Saucheans, and Sophar, the king of the Minaians."}]}
