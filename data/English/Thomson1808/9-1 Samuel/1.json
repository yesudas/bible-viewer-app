Nevertheless, Elkana loved Anna more than the other, though the Lord had shut up her womb."},{"number":6,"verse":"But because the Lord had not given her a child, such was her affliction and anxiety on the account of this, that she became disconsolate, because the Lord had shut up her womb, so as not to give her a child."},{"number":7,"verse":"Thus he acted, year after year, when he went up to the house of the Lord.
