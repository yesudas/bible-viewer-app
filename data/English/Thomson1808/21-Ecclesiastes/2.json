Take a view of that considered as a good. But behold this also is vanity."},{"number":2,"verse":"To laughter I said, It is madness; and to mirth, What is this thou art doing?"},{"number":3,"verse":"Now I had examined whether my mind could lead my flesh to wine; and my mind had led it with wisdom, retaining a command over pleasure, until I should see of what sort that good is, which the sons of men are to pursue under the sun, all the days of their life."},{"number":4,"verse":"I enlarged my plan of operations. I built me houses. I planted me vineyards."},{"number":5,"verse":"I made me gardens and orchards and planted therein all sorts of fruit trees."},{"number":6,"verse":"I made me pools of water, to water from them my blooming nurseries."},{"number":7,"verse":"I purchased men servants and maid servants; and had servants born in my family. And my stock of herds and flocks was great above all who were before me in Jerusalem."},{"number":8,"verse":"I collected also for myself silver and gold and the choicest treasures of kings and countries.

Nevertheless I knew that one event will happen to them all."},{"number":15,"verse":"Therefore I said in my heart, As the same event will happen to me as happeneth to the fool, why have I studied wisdom? Why communed abundantly with my heart? Because even this is vanity; (since out of an abundance the fool speaketh)"},{"number":16,"verse":"because there is no remembrance forever of the wise man more than of the fool (seeing the days are now coming when all shall be for gotten and the wise must die as well as the fool)"},{"number":17,"verse":"therefore I hated the whole of this life; because the work which was done under the sun was toilsome to me; because all are vanity and vexation of spirit:"},{"number":18,"verse":"and I hated all this labour of mine for which I am toiling under the sun; because I must leave it to a man who is coming after me;"},{"number":19,"verse":"and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool?

(b) With respect to that I saw indeed that even this is from the hand of God;"},{"number":25,"verse":"for who can eat or who can drink without him?"},{"number":26,"verse":"For to the man who is good in his sight he hath given wisdom and knowledge and joy; and to the sinner he hath given the trouble of gathering and heaping up to give to him who is good in the sight of God. So that this also is vanity and vexation of spirit."}]}
