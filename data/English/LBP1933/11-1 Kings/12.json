Kings 131 AND, behold, there came a prophet out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Beth-el; and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense on the fifteenth day of the month, according to the feast which was in Judah. And he burned incense on the altar."},{"number":2,"verse":"And when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it (for he had fled from the presence of King Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt) And the prophet cried against the altar by the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, hear the word of the LORD, thus says the LORD: Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon you he shall offer the priests of the temples of idols who burn incense upon you, and men's bones shall be burnt upon you."},{"number":3,"verse":"Then they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the people of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD has sent me: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out."},{"number":4,"verse":"Your father made our yoke harsh; now therefore lighten some of the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve you. And when the king heard the saying of the prophet of God which he had cried against the altar in Beth-el, the king, standing at the altar, put forth his hand, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him."},{"number":5,"verse":"And he said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. So all the people departed. The altar also was broken, and the ashes which were upon it poured out, according to the sign which the prophet of God had given by the word of the LORD."},{"number":6,"verse":"And King Rehoboam consulted with the old men who had stood before his father while he was still alive, and said to them, How do you advise that I may answer the people? And the king answered and said to the prophet of God, Pray for me before the LORD your God, and entreat for me that my hand may be restored to me. And the prophet of God prayed before the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before."},{"number":7,"verse":"And they said to him, If you will be a servant to this people this day and will serve them and answer them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants for ever.

For so it was charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, and drink no water, nor return again by the way that you came."},{"number":10,"verse":"And the young men who were grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you speak to the people who have said to you, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter for us; thus shall you say to them, My little finger is thicker than my father's thumb. So he went by another way, and did not return by the way that he came to Beth-el."},{"number":11,"verse":"And now whereas my father laid a heavy yoke upon you, I will add to your yoke; my father has chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with knouts.

And his sons showed him the way by which the prophet of God went, who came from Judah."},{"number":13,"verse":"And the king answered the people harshly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him; And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass; and he rode on it,"},{"number":14,"verse":"And spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with knouts. And went after the prophet of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to him, Are you the prophet of God who came from Judah? And he said, I am."},{"number":15,"verse":"Wherefore the king did not listen to the people; for the stirring of strife was from the LORD, that the LORD might perform his saying which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet, the Shilonite, unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat. Then he said to him, Come home with me and eat bread."},{"number":16,"verse":"So when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O Israel; now see to your own house, David.

Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD and have not kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you."},{"number":22,"verse":"But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the prophet of God, saying, But have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which the LORD said to you, You shall not eat bread, nor drink water; therefore your corpse shall not come into the sepulchre of your fathers."},{"number":23,"verse":"Speak to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, And after the two prophets had eaten bread and had drunk, they saddled the ass for the prophet of God."},{"number":24,"verse":"Thus says the LORD: You shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel; return every man to his house; for this thing is from me.

And, behold, men passed by and saw the corpse cast in the way and the ass standing beside it, and the lion also standing beside the corpse; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt."},{"number":26,"verse":"And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now the kingdom will return to the house of David; And when the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it, he said. It is the prophet of God who disobeyed the word of the LORD; therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke to him."},{"number":27,"verse":"If this people go up to do sacrifices at the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah. And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass, and they saddled it."},{"number":28,"verse":"So the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said to all Israel, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!

So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing to the calves that he had made; and he appointed in Beth-el priests for the temples of idols which he had made. For the saying which he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Beth-el and against all the temples of idols which are in the cities of Samaria shall surely come to pass."},{"number":33,"verse":"And he went to the altar which he had made in Beth-el, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and made a feast to the children of Israel; and he went up to the altar to burn incense. After this thing Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but made again from among the people priests for the temples of idols; whosoever would become a priest, he offered an offering and thus became the priest of the temple of idols."}]}
