I hope that it is to no purpose."},{"number":5,"verse":"He therefore who gives you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he do these things by the works of the law, or by obedience to faith?"},{"number":6,"verse":"Just as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness,"},{"number":7,"verse":"You must know therefore, that those who trust on faith are the children of Abraham."},{"number":8,"verse":"Because God knew in advance that the Gentiles would be declared righteous through faith, he first preached to Abraham, as it is said in the Holy Scripture, In you shall all the Gentiles be blessed."},{"number":9,"verse":"So then, it is the believers who are blessed through Abraham the faithful."},{"number":10,"verse":"For those who rely on the works of the law are still under the curse: for as it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not practice everything which is written in the book of the law."},{"number":11,"verse":"But that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, as it is written, The righteous shall live by faith."},{"number":12,"verse":"Thus the law is not made by faith, but, Whosoever shall do the things which are written in it shall live in it."},{"number":13,"verse":"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, by becoming accursed for our sakes: for it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a cross:"},{"number":14,"verse":"That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."},{"number":15,"verse":"My brethren, I speak as a man; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man can reject it or change anything in it."},{"number":16,"verse":"Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his seed as a covenant.
