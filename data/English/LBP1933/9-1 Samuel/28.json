And Achish said to David, Therefore I will make you my bodyguard forever. And the lords of the Philistines were passing in review by hundreds and by thousands; but David and his men marched in the rear with Achish."},{"number":3,"verse":"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned over him and buried him in Ramtha in his own sepulchre. And Saul had put away the diviners and the wizards out of the land. Then the princes of the Philistines said to Achish, Why are these men marching here? And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, This is David, the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, who has been with us a year and some months, and I have found no fault in him from the day he came to me until this day."},{"number":4,"verse":"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shechem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilgal. But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and they said to him, Drive this fellow out of the camp, that he may return to his place which you have assigned him; and let him not go with us to the battle, lest he be an adversary to us there; for how could this man reconcile himself to his lord, except with our heads?"},{"number":5,"verse":"And when Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.

And what have you found in your servant from the day that I have come to you until this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"},{"number":9,"verse":"And the woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has removed those who have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life to cause me to be put to death?

And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and made obeisance."},{"number":15,"verse":"And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines are making war against me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more although I have inquired by the prophets and also by dreams; therefore I have called you, that you may tell me what I shall do."},{"number":16,"verse":"Then Samuel said to Saul, Why do you ask of me, seeing the LORD has departed from you, and now he is with your neighbor David?"},{"number":17,"verse":"And the LORD has done to him, as he spoke by me; for he has rent asunder the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor David;"},{"number":18,"verse":"Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD and did not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you this day."},{"number":19,"verse":"Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me; the LORD also shall deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines."},{"number":20,"verse":"Then Saul fell straightway upon his face on the ground, and was exceedingly afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all that day, nor all that night."},{"number":21,"verse":"And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was exceedingly afraid, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in your hand, and have listened to the words which you spoke to me."},{"number":22,"verse":"Now therefore, listen also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, because you are going on a journey."},{"number":23,"verse":"But he refused, and said, I will not eat.
