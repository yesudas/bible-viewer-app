Then I said in my heart, This also is vanity."},{"number":16,"verse":"The fool speaks superficially, but there is no remembrance of the wise man more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is, in the days to come shall be forgotten.

This also is vanity."},{"number":24,"verse":"There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of the LORD."},{"number":25,"verse":"For who can eat or who can drink except he?"},{"number":26,"verse":"For, to a man who is good in his presence, God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy; but to the sinner he gives toil, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who is good in the presence of the LORD. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit,"}]}
