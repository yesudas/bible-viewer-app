What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?”"},{"number":4,"verse":"And he said to them, “Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me: he has hired me, and I have become his priest.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"And they said to him, “Inquire of God, we pray thee, that we may know whether the journey on which we are setting out will succeed.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"And the priest said to them, “Go in peace. The journey on which you go is under the eye of the LORD.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"Then the five men departed, and came to La′ish, and saw the people who were there, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Sido′nians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking (Cn Compare 18.10. The Hebrew text is uncertain) nothing that is in the earth, and possessing wealth, and how they were far from the Sido′nians and had no dealings with any one."},{"number":8,"verse":"And when they came to their brethren at Zorah and Esh′ta-ol, their brethren said to them, “What do you report?”"},{"number":9,"verse":"They said, “Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very fertile.

The land is broad; yea, God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.”"},{"number":11,"verse":"And six hundred men of the tribe of Dan, armed with weapons of war, set forth from Zorah and Esh′ta-ol,"},{"number":12,"verse":"and went up and encamped at Kir′iath-je′arim in Judah. On this account that place is called Ma′haneh-dan (That is Camp of Dan) to this day; behold, it is west of Kir′iath-je′arim."},{"number":13,"verse":"And they passed on from there to the hill country of E′phraim, and came to the house of Micah."},{"number":14,"verse":"Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of La′ish said to their brethren, “Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, teraphim, a graven image, and a molten image?

Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and family in Israel?”"},{"number":20,"verse":"And the priest’s heart was glad; he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people."},{"number":21,"verse":"So they turned and departed, putting the little ones and the cattle and the goods in front of them."},{"number":22,"verse":"When they were a good way from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house were called out, and they overtook the Danites."},{"number":23,"verse":"And they shouted to the Danites, who turned round and said to Micah, “What ails you that you come with such a company?”"},{"number":24,"verse":"And he said, “You take my gods which I made, and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then do you ask me, ‘What ails you?’”"},{"number":25,"verse":"And the Danites said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household.”"},{"number":26,"verse":"Then the Danites went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home."},{"number":27,"verse":"(The Danites Settle in Laish) And taking what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, the Danites came to La′ish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and burned the city with fire."},{"number":28,"verse":"And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any one.
