Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?"},{"number":2,"verse":"Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?"},{"number":3,"verse":"Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh?"},{"number":4,"verse":"Did you experience so many things in vain? — if it really is in vain."},{"number":5,"verse":"Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?"},{"number":6,"verse":"Thus Abraham “believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"So you see that it is men of faith who are the sons of Abraham."},{"number":8,"verse":"And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"So then, those who are men of faith are blessed with Abraham who had faith."},{"number":10,"verse":"For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed be every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, and do them.”"},{"number":11,"verse":"Now it is evident that no man is justified before God by the law; for “He who through faith is righteous shall live”; (Or the righteous shall live by faith)"},{"number":12,"verse":"but the law does not rest on faith, for “He who does them shall live by them.”"},{"number":13,"verse":"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us — for it is written, “Cursed be every one who hangs on a tree” —"},{"number":14,"verse":"that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."},{"number":15,"verse":"The Promise to Abraham To give a human example, brethren: no one annuls even a man’s will, (Or covenant (as in verse 17)) or adds to it, once it has been ratified."},{"number":16,"verse":"Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many; but, referring to one, “And to your offspring,” which is Christ."},{"number":17,"verse":"This is what I mean: the law, which came four hundred and thirty years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void."},{"number":18,"verse":"For if the inheritance is by the law, it is no longer by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise."},{"number":19,"verse":"The Purpose of the Law Why then the law?
