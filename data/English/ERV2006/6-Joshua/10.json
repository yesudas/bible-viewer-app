He also learned that the Gibeonites had made a peace agreement with Israel and that they lived very near Jerusalem."},{"number":2,"verse":"So Adoni Zedek and his people were very frightened. Gibeon was not a small town like Ai. It was a very big city—as big as any royal city. (royal city A strong, well-protected city that controlled smaller towns nearby.)

The LORD your God has given you the victory over them.”"},{"number":20,"verse":"So Joshua and the Israelites killed the enemy. But some of them were able to go to their cities that had tall walls around them and hide.
