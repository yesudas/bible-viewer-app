They put old pieces of cloth on their animals to look as if they had traveled from far away."},{"number":5,"verse":"The men put old sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. They found some old bread that was dry and moldy."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then they went to the camp of the Israelites. This camp was near Gilgal.

Where do you come from?”"},{"number":9,"verse":"The men answered, “We are your servants. We have come from a faraway country. We came because we heard of the great power of the LORD your God.

All of your people will be slaves—they will have to cut wood and carry water for the house of God. (house of God This might mean the “family of God” (Israel), “the Holy Tent,” or “the Temple.”) ”"},{"number":24,"verse":"The Gibeonites answered, “We lied to you because we were afraid you would kill us. We heard that God commanded his servant Moses to give you all this land. And God told you to kill all the people who lived in this land. That is why we lied to you."},{"number":25,"verse":"Now we are your servants.
