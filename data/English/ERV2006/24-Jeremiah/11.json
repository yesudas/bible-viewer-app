Then you will be my people and I will be your God.’"},{"number":5,"verse":"“I did this to keep the promise that I had made to your ancestors. I promised to give them a very fertile land—a land flowing with milk and honey. And you are living in that country today.” I answered, “Amen, LORD.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"The LORD said to me, “Jeremiah, tell this message in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Listen to the words of this agreement, and then obey these laws."},{"number":7,"verse":"I gave a warning to your ancestors at the time I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I have warned them again and again to this day. I told them to obey me."},{"number":8,"verse":"But your ancestors did not listen to me. They were stubborn and did what their own evil hearts wanted.

The family of Israel and the family of Judah have broken the agreement I made with their ancestors.”"},{"number":11,"verse":"So this is what the LORD says: “I will soon make something terrible happen to the people of Judah. They will not be able to escape. They will be sorry and cry to me for help, but I will not listen to them."},{"number":12,"verse":"The people in the towns of Judah and in the city of Jerusalem will go and pray to their idols for help. They burn incense to those idols. But their idols will not be able to help the people of Judah when that terrible disaster comes."},{"number":13,"verse":"“People of Judah, you have many idols—there are as many idols as there are towns in Judah. You have built many altars for worshiping that disgusting god Baal—there are as many altars as there are streets in Jerusalem."},{"number":14,"verse":"“As for you, Jeremiah, don’t pray for these people of Judah. Don’t beg for them. Don’t say prayers for them. I will not listen. They will suffer and then call to me for help, but I will not listen."},{"number":15,"verse":"“Judah is the one I love, but why is she in my temple? She has done too many evil things. Judah, do you think vows and sacrifices will keep you from being destroyed? Will I then allow you to enjoy your evil ways?”"},{"number":16,"verse":"The LORD gave you a name. He called you, “A green olive tree, beautiful to look at.” But with a powerful storm, he will set that tree on fire, and its branches will be burned up. (The meaning of these verses is uncertain.)"},{"number":17,"verse":"The LORD All-Powerful planted you, and he said that disaster will come to you. That is because the family of Israel and the family of Judah have done evil things.

The people who were plotting against him there included his own relatives. See Jer. 12:6.) were making plans against me. He showed me what they were doing, so I knew they were against me."},{"number":19,"verse":"Before he showed me this, I was like a gentle lamb waiting to be butchered. I did not understand that they were against me. They were saying this about me: “Let us destroy the tree and its fruit! Let us kill him! Then people will forget him.”"},{"number":20,"verse":"So I prayed, “LORD All-Powerful, you are a fair judge. You know how to test people’s hearts and minds. I will tell you my arguments, and I will let you give them the punishment they deserve.”"},{"number":21,"verse":"The LORD said to me, “Those people from Anathoth are planning to take your life. They are telling you not to prophesy in the name of the LORD or they will kill you. This is what I have to say about them:"},{"number":22,"verse":"I, the LORD All-Powerful, promise that I will soon punish those people. Their young men will die in war. Their sons and daughters will die from hunger."},{"number":23,"verse":"No one from the city of Anathoth will be left. No one will survive. I will punish them and cause something bad to happen to them.”"}]}
