If he did, (If he did It was against the Law of Moses for a man to marry a woman he had divorced if that woman had become another man’s wife. See Deut. 24:1-4.) it would make the land unclean. Judah, you and all your false gods are like a prostitute with many lovers! So why do you think you can come back to me?” This message is from the LORD."},{"number":2,"verse":"“Look up to the bare hilltops, Judah. Is there any place where you have not had sex with your lovers? You sat by the road waiting for lovers, like an Arab in the desert. You made the land ‘dirty’ with all the evil sins you did when you were unfaithful to me."},{"number":3,"verse":"You sinned, so the rain has not come. There has not been any springtime rains.

They will not even remember or miss it. They will never make another Holy Box."},{"number":17,"verse":"At that time the city of Jerusalem will be called the ‘LORD’s Throne.’ All nations will come together in the city of Jerusalem to give honor to the name of the LORD.
