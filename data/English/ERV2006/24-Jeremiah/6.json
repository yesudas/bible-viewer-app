Check each vine, like the workers check each vine when they pick the grapes.”"},{"number":10,"verse":"Who can I speak to? Who can I warn? Who will listen to me? The people of Israel have closed their ears, so they cannot hear my warnings. They don’t like the LORD’s teachings. They don’t want to hear his message."},{"number":11,"verse":"But I am full of the LORD’s anger, and I am tired of holding it in! “Pour out my anger on the children playing in the streets and on the young soldiers gathered there as well.

Sheba controlled the spice trade in the time of Jeremiah.) ? Why do you bring me sweet-smelling cane from a faraway country? Your burnt offerings don’t make me happy. Your sacrifices don’t please me.”"},{"number":21,"verse":"So this is what the LORD says: “I will give the people of Judah problems. They will be like stones that make people fall. Fathers and sons will stumble over them. Friends and neighbors will die.”"},{"number":22,"verse":"This is what the LORD says: “An army is coming from the north.

The bellows (bellows A tool for blowing air on a fire to make the fire hotter.) blew strongly, and the fire became hotter, but only lead came from the fire. (lead came from the fire Workers melted metals like silver to make the metals pure. Lead was the first metal to melt, so the workers poured the lead out, leaving the other metal pure. Here, Jeremiah is saying the people are all bad—they are all lead and no silver!) The worker wasted his time trying to make that silver pure. In the same way the evil was not removed from my people."},{"number":30,"verse":"My people will be called ‘Rejected Silver.’ They will be given that name because the LORD did not accept them.”"}]}
