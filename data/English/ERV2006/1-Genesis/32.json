While he was traveling, he saw God’s angels."},{"number":2,"verse":"When he saw them, he said, “This is God’s camp!” So Jacob named that place Mahanaim.

He has 400 men with him.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"Jacob was very frightened and worried. He divided the people who were with him and all the flocks, herds, and camels into two groups."},{"number":8,"verse":"Jacob thought, “If Esau comes and destroys one group, the other group can run away and be saved.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"Then Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham!

And he also is coming behind us.’”"},{"number":19,"verse":"Jacob also ordered the second servant, the third servant, and all the other servants to do the same thing. He said, “You will say the same thing to Esau when you meet him."},{"number":20,"verse":"You will say, ‘This is a gift to you, and your servant Jacob is behind us.’” Jacob thought, “If I send these men ahead with gifts, maybe Esau will forgive me and accept me.”"},{"number":21,"verse":"So Jacob sent the gifts to Esau, but he stayed that night in the camp."},{"number":22,"verse":"During the night, Jacob got up and began moving his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven sons across the Jabbok River at the crossing."},{"number":23,"verse":"After he sent his family across the river, he sent across everything he had."},{"number":24,"verse":"The Fight With God Jacob was left alone, and a man came and wrestled with him.

Your name will now be Israel. (Israel This name might mean “he fights for God,” “he fights with God,” or “God fights.”) I give you this name because you have fought with God and with men, and you have won.”"},{"number":29,"verse":"Then Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.” But the man said, “Why do you ask my name?” Then the man blessed Jacob at that place."},{"number":30,"verse":"So Jacob named that place Peniel.

He was limping because of his leg."},{"number":32,"verse":"So even today, the people of Israel don’t eat the muscle that is on the hip joint, because this is the muscle where Jacob was hurt."}]}
