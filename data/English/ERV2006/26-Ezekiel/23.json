That’s where they first let men touch and handle their young breasts."},{"number":4,"verse":"The older daughter was named Oholah, (Oholah This name means “Tent.” It probably refers to the Holy Tent where the people of Israel went to worship God.) and her sister was named Oholibah. (Oholibah This name means “My Tent is in her country.” Also in verses 18, 21.) They became my wives, and we had children.

You will throw down the glass and break it to pieces. You will tear at your breasts from the pain. This will happen because I am the Lord GOD, and this is what I said."},{"number":35,"verse":"“So this is what the Lord GOD said: ‘Jerusalem, you forgot me. You threw me away and left me behind.

(party The Hebrew word is like the word for a fellowship offering, a time when people came to share a meal and enjoy themselves together with the Lord. Here, it seems this time of worship turned into a wild party. See Deut. 14:22-29; 26:1-15.) Many people came to the party. People were already drinking as they came in from the desert. They gave bracelets and beautiful crowns to the women."},{"number":43,"verse":"Then I spoke to one of the women who was worn out from her sexual sins. I asked her, ‘Will they continue to do sexual sins with her, and she with them?’"},{"number":44,"verse":"But they kept going to her as they would go to a prostitute.
