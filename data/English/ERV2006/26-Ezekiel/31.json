Its top was among the clouds!"},{"number":4,"verse":"The water made the tree grow. The deep river made the tree tall. Rivers flowed around the place where the tree was planted. Only small streams flowed from that tree to all the other trees of the field."},{"number":5,"verse":"So that tree was taller than all the other trees of the field, and it grew many branches. There was plenty of water, so the tree branches spread out."},{"number":6,"verse":"All the birds of the sky made their nests in the branches of that tree, and all the animals of the field gave birth under the branches of that tree.
