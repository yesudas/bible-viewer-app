He said,"},{"number":2,"verse":"“Why do you people say this proverb: ‘The parents ate the sour grapes, but the children got the sour taste’ (The parents … sour taste This means the children were suffering for things their parents did.) ?”"},{"number":3,"verse":"But the Lord GOD says, “By my life, I swear that people in Israel will not think this proverb is true anymore!"},{"number":4,"verse":"I will treat everyone, child and parent, just the same.

He is fair and does what is right."},{"number":6,"verse":"He doesn’t go to the mountains to share food offered to idols. He doesn’t pray to those filthy idols in Israel. He doesn’t commit adultery with his neighbor’s wife or with a woman during her period."},{"number":7,"verse":"He doesn’t take advantage of others. If someone borrows money from him, he might take something of value before he gives the money. But when that person pays him back, he returns what he took. He gives food to the hungry and clothes to people who need them."},{"number":8,"verse":"If someone wants to borrow money from him, he lends the money and doesn’t charge interest on the loan.

He will remember only their goodness, so they will live!”"},{"number":23,"verse":"The Lord GOD says, “I don’t want evil people to die. I want them to change their lives so that they can live!"},{"number":24,"verse":"“Now, maybe good people might stop being good. They might change their lives and begin to do all the terrible things that evil people have done in the past. (The evil people changed, so they can live.) So if those good people change and become bad, God will not remember all the good things they did. He will remember that they turned against him and began to sin.
