When you do something good, don’t do it in front of others so that they will see you. If you do that, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven."},{"number":2,"verse":"“When you give to those who are poor, don’t announce that you are giving. Don’t be like the hypocrites. When they are in the synagogues and on the streets, they blow trumpets before they give so that people will see them. They want everyone to praise them. The truth is, that’s all the reward they will get."},{"number":3,"verse":"So when you give to the poor, don’t let anyone know what you are doing. (don’t … doing Literally, “don’t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.”)"},{"number":4,"verse":"Your giving should be done in private. Your Father can see what is done in private, and he will reward you."},{"number":5,"verse":"(Jesus Teaches About Prayer) “When you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites. They love to stand in the synagogues and on the street corners and pray loudly. They want people to see them. The truth is, that’s all the reward they will get."},{"number":6,"verse":"But when you pray, you should go into your room and close the door. Then pray to your Father. He is there in that private place. He can see what is done in private, and he will reward you."},{"number":7,"verse":"“And when you pray, don’t be like the people who don’t know God. They say the same things again and again. They think that if they say it enough, their god will hear them."},{"number":8,"verse":"Don’t be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask him."},{"number":9,"verse":"So this is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, we pray that your name will always be kept holy."},{"number":10,"verse":"We pray that your kingdom will come— that what you want will be done here on earth, the same as in heaven."},{"number":11,"verse":"Give us the food we need for today."},{"number":12,"verse":"Forgive our sins, just as we have forgiven those who did wrong to us."},{"number":13,"verse":"Don’t let us be tempted, but save us from the Evil One.’ (Some Greek copies add: “For the kingdom and the power and the glory belong to you forever and ever. Amen.”)"},{"number":14,"verse":"Yes, if you forgive others for the wrongs they do to you, then your Father in heaven will also forgive your wrongs."},{"number":15,"verse":"But if you don’t forgive others, then your Father in heaven will not forgive the wrongs you do."},{"number":16,"verse":"(Jesus Teaches About Fasting) “When you fast, don’t make yourselves look sad like the hypocrites. They put a look of suffering on their faces so that people will see they are fasting. The truth is, that’s all the reward they will get."},{"number":17,"verse":"So when you fast, wash your face and make yourself look nice."},{"number":18,"verse":"Then no one will know you are fasting, except your Father, who is with you even in private. He can see what is done in private, and he will reward you."},{"number":19,"verse":"(You Cannot Serve Two Masters) “Don’t save treasures for yourselves here on earth. Moths and rust will destroy them. And thieves can break into your house and steal them."},{"number":20,"verse":"Instead, save your treasures in heaven, where they cannot be destroyed by moths or rust and where thieves cannot break in and steal them."},{"number":21,"verse":"Your heart will be where your treasure is."},{"number":22,"verse":"“The only source of light for the body is the eye. If you look at people and want to help them, you will be full of light."},{"number":23,"verse":"But if you look at people in a selfish way, you will be full of darkness. And if the only light you have is really darkness, you have the worst kind of darkness. (Literally, “22 The lamp of the body is the eye. So, if your eye is pure, your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. So, if the light in you is darkness, how much is the darkness.”)"},{"number":24,"verse":"“You cannot serve two masters at the same time. You will hate one and love the other, or you will be loyal to one and not care about the other. You cannot serve God and Money (Money Or “ mamona,” an Aramaic word meaning “wealth.”) at the same time."},{"number":25,"verse":"(Put God’s Kingdom First) “So I tell you, don’t worry about the things you need to live—what you will eat, drink, or wear. Life is more important than food, and the body is more important than what you put on it."},{"number":26,"verse":"Look at the birds. They don’t plant, harvest, or save food in barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Don’t you know you are worth much more than they are?"},{"number":27,"verse":"You cannot add any time to your life by worrying about it."},{"number":28,"verse":"“And why do you worry about clothes? Look at the wildflowers in the field. See how they grow. They don’t work or make clothes for themselves."},{"number":29,"verse":"But I tell you that even Solomon, the great and rich king, was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers."},{"number":30,"verse":"If God makes what grows in the field so beautiful, what do you think he will do for you? It’s just grass—one day it’s alive, and the next day someone throws it into a fire. But God cares enough to make it beautiful. Surely he will do much more for you. Your faith is so small!"},{"number":31,"verse":"“Don’t worry and say, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’"},{"number":32,"verse":"That’s what those people who don’t know God are always thinking about. Don’t worry, because your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things."},{"number":33,"verse":"What you should want most is God’s kingdom and doing what he wants you to do. Then he will give you all these other things you need."},{"number":34,"verse":"So don’t worry about tomorrow. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Tomorrow will have its own worries."}]}
