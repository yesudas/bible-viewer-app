He offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar."},{"number":5,"verse":"While Solomon was at Gibeon, the LORD came to him at night in a dream. God said, “Solomon, ask me what you want me to give you.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"Solomon answered, “You were very kind and loyal to your servant, my father David.

There are so many that they cannot be counted."},{"number":9,"verse":"So I ask you to give me the wisdom to rule and judge them well and to help me know the difference between right and wrong.

You did not ask for the death of your enemies. You asked for the wisdom to listen and make the right decisions."},{"number":12,"verse":"So I will give you what you asked for. I will make you wise and intelligent. I will make you wiser than anyone who ever lived or ever will live."},{"number":13,"verse":"And I will also give you what you did not ask for.
