He killed two of the commanders of Israel’s army, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. Remember, it was during a time of peace when he spilled the blood that splattered onto his sword belt and army boots.

Please don’t refuse me.” Bathsheba answered, “What do you want?”"},{"number":17,"verse":"Adonijah said, “I know that King Solomon will do whatever you ask.

I will not kill you now because you helped carry the Holy Box of the Lord GOD while marching with my father David. And I know that you shared in the hard times with my father.”"},{"number":27,"verse":"So Solomon told Abiathar that he could not continue to serve as a priest of the LORD. This happened as the LORD said it would when he told Eli the priest what would happen to him and his family.

Kill him there and take him out to bury him. Then my family and I will be free of Joab’s guilt from killing innocent people."},{"number":32,"verse":"Joab killed two men who were much better than he was.
