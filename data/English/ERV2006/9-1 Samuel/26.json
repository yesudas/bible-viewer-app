David was out in the desert and saw that Saul had come out into the desert after him."},{"number":4,"verse":"So David sent out spies to know for certain that Saul had come after him again."},{"number":5,"verse":"Then David went to where Saul had set up his camp. David saw where Saul and Abner were sleeping. (Abner son of Ner was the commander of Saul’s army.) Saul was sleeping in the center of a circle of men that surrounded him."},{"number":6,"verse":"David talked to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah. (Abishai was Joab’s brother.) He asked them, “Who would like to go down into the camp with me after Saul?” Abishai answered, “I’ll go with you.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"When night came, David and Abishai went into Saul’s camp. Saul was asleep in the middle of the circle of men. His spear was stuck in the ground near his head.

I’ll only do it once!”"},{"number":9,"verse":"But David said to Abishai, “Don’t kill Saul!

Why are you calling the king?”"},{"number":15,"verse":"David said, “You are an important man, aren’t you? You are better than any other man in Israel. Is that right? So why didn’t you guard your master, the king? An ordinary man came into your camp to kill your master, the king."},{"number":16,"verse":"You made a big mistake. As surely as the LORD is alive, you and your men should die, because you didn’t protect your master, the LORD’s chosen king. Look for the king’s spear and the water jug that was near Saul’s head. Where are they?”"},{"number":17,"verse":"Saul knew David’s voice and said, “Is that your voice, David my son?” David answered, “Yes, it is my voice, my lord the king."},{"number":18,"verse":"Sir, why are you chasing me? What wrong have I done? What am I guilty of?"},{"number":19,"verse":"My lord the king, listen to me. If the LORD caused you to be angry with me, let him accept an offering.

The king of Israel has come out looking for a flea. You are like a man hunting partridges in the mountains.” (hunting partridges in the mountains People hunted these birds until the birds became too tired to go on. Then they killed the birds. Saul was chasing David the same way. This is also a wordplay. The Hebrew word for “partridge” is like the word for “calling” in verse 14.)"},{"number":21,"verse":"Then Saul said, “David, my son! I have sinned. Come back. Today you showed me that my life is important to you, so I won’t try to hurt you. I have acted foolishly. I have made a big mistake.”"},{"number":22,"verse":"David answered, “Here is the king’s spear. Let one of your young men come here and get it."},{"number":23,"verse":"The LORD pays every man for what he does—he rewards him if he does right, and he punishes him if he does wrong. The LORD gave you to me today, but I wouldn’t harm the LORD’s chosen king."},{"number":24,"verse":"Today I showed you that your life is important to me. In the same way the LORD will show that my life is important to him. He will save me from every trouble.”"},{"number":25,"verse":"Then Saul said to David, “God bless you, David my son. You will do great things and you will win.” David went on his way, and Saul went back home."}]}
