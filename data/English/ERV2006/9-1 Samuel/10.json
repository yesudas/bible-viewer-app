He has anointed you to be ruler over his people. Here is a sign that will prove this is true: (You will control … true This is from the ancient Greek version.)"},{"number":2,"verse":"After you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel’s tomb on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah.

He is saying: What will I do about my son?’”"},{"number":3,"verse":"Samuel said, “Then you will go until you come to the large oak tree at Tabor. Three men will meet you there.

These places were often on the hills and mountains.) They will be prophesying. (prophesying This usually means “speaking for God.” But here, this also means that the Spirit of God took control of people, causing them to sing and dance. Also in verses 11, 13.) They will be playing harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then the LORD’s Spirit will come on you with great power. You will be changed. You will be like a different man.

God touched the hearts of brave men who then began to follow Saul."},{"number":27,"verse":"But some troublemakers said, “How can this man save us?” They said bad things about Saul and refused to bring gifts to him. But Saul said nothing. King Nahash of the Ammonites had been hurting the tribes of Gad and Reuben. Nahash poked out the right eye of each of the men and did not allow anyone to help them. He poked out the right eye of every Israelite man living in the area east of the Jordan River. But 7000 Israelite men ran away from the Ammonites and came to Jabesh Gilead. (Nahash … came to Jabesh Gilead This is found in some ancient versions and in a Hebrew scroll from Qumran but not in the standard Hebrew text.)"}]}
