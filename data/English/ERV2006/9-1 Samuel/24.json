David and his men were deep inside that same cave."},{"number":4,"verse":"David’s men told him, “This is day the LORD told you about when he said, ‘I will give your enemy to you, and you can do whatever you want to him.’” So David crawled closer and closer to Saul and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe.
