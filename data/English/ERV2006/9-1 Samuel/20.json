What is my crime? Why is your father trying to kill me?”"},{"number":2,"verse":"Jonathan answered, “That can’t be true! My father isn’t trying to kill you. My father doesn’t do anything without first telling me. It doesn’t matter how important it is, my father always tells me. Why would my father refuse to tell me that he wants to kill you? No, it is not true!”"},{"number":3,"verse":"But David answered, “Your father knows very well that I am your friend. Your father said to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know about it. If he knows, he will tell David.’ (he will tell David This is from the ancient Greek version. The standard Hebrew text here has “he will be upset.”) But as surely as you and the LORD are alive, I am very close to death.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"Jonathan said to David, “I will do anything you want me to do.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"Then David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon celebration. I am supposed to eat with the king, but let me hide in the field until the evening."},{"number":6,"verse":"If your father notices I am gone, tell him, ‘David wanted to go home to Bethlehem.

Then, in three days, I will send a message to you in the field."},{"number":13,"verse":"If my father wants to hurt you, I will let you know. I will let you leave in safety. May the LORD punish me if I don’t do this. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father."},{"number":14,"verse":"[14-15] As long as I live, show me the same kindness the LORD does.

If everything is fine, I will tell the boy, ‘You went too far! The arrows are closer to me. Come back and get them.’ If I say that, you can come out of hiding. I promise, as surely as the LORD lives, you are safe. There is no danger."},{"number":22,"verse":"But if there is trouble, I will say to the boy, ‘The arrows are farther away. Go get them.’ If I say that, you must leave. The LORD is sending you away."},{"number":23,"verse":"Remember this agreement between you and me. The LORD is our witness forever.”"},{"number":24,"verse":"Then David hid in the field. The time for the New Moon celebration came, and the king sat down to eat."},{"number":25,"verse":"He sat next to the wall where he usually sat, and Jonathan sat across from him.

Our family is having a sacrifice in Bethlehem. My brother ordered me to be there.

So Jonathan knew that his father wanted very much to kill David."},{"number":34,"verse":"Jonathan became angry and left the table.
