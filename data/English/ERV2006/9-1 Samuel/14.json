These men did not know that Jonathan had left."},{"number":4,"verse":"Jonathan was planning to go through a pass to get to the Philistine camp. There was a large rock on each side of the pass.

(foreigners Literally, “uncircumcised.” This means people who did not share in the agreement God made with Israel. See “circumcise, circumcision” in the Word List.) Maybe the LORD will use us to defeat them. Nothing can stop the LORD—it doesn’t matter if we have many soldiers or just a few soldiers.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"The young man who carried Jonathan’s weapons said to him, “Do what you think is best. Whatever you decide, I am with you all the way.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"Jonathan said, “Let’s go! We’ll cross the valley and go to the Philistine guards.

He ate the honey and began to feel much better."},{"number":28,"verse":"One of the soldiers told Jonathan, “Your father forced the soldiers to make a special promise. He said that any man who eats today will be under a curse. So the men have not eaten anything.
