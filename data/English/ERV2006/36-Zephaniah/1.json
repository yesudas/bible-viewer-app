He received this message during the time that Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah. Zephaniah was the son of Cushi, who was the son of Gedaliah. Gedaliah was the son of Amariah, who was the son of Hezekiah."},{"number":2,"verse":"(The Lord’s Day for Judging the People) The LORD says, “I will destroy everything on earth. (earth Or “the land” or “the country.” Also in verse 18.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"I will destroy all the people and all the animals. I will destroy the birds in the air and the fish in the sea. I will destroy the evil people and everything that makes them sin. I will remove all people from the earth.” This is what the LORD said."},{"number":4,"verse":"“I will punish Judah and the people living in Jerusalem. I will remove from this place any signs of Baal worship. No one will remember the priests who serve the idols there."},{"number":5,"verse":"And those who go up on their roofs to worship the stars (stars Literally, “army of heaven.” This might mean the stars and planets or the angels.) will be forgotten.

They no longer ask me, the LORD, for help.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"Be silent before the Lord GOD, because the LORD’s day for judging the people is coming soon. The LORD has prepared his sacrifice, and he has told his invited guests to get ready. (prepared … get ready Literally, “prepared his sacrifice. He has made his called ones holy.” Here, this time of judgment is compared to a fellowship meal when priests offered a sacrifice to God and had the guests get ready for this special meal with God.)"},{"number":8,"verse":"The Lord said, “On the LORD’s day of sacrifice, I will punish the king’s sons and other leaders. I will punish all the people wearing clothes from other countries."},{"number":9,"verse":"At that time I will punish all the people who jump over the threshold (people wearing … threshold This probably means the priests and people who worshiped foreign gods, such as Dagon, or people who copied their ways of worshiping.

I will find all those who are satisfied to live their own way. They say, ‘The LORD does nothing. He does not help, and he does not hurt!’ I will find them, and I will punish them."},{"number":13,"verse":"Then others will take their wealth and destroy their houses. Those who built houses will not live in them, and those who planted vineyards will not drink the wine from the grapes.”"},{"number":14,"verse":"The LORD’s special day for judging is coming soon! It is near and coming fast. People will hear very sad sounds on the LORD’s special day of judgment. Even strong soldiers will cry."},{"number":15,"verse":"The Lord will show his anger at that time. It will be a time of terrible troubles and a time of destruction.
