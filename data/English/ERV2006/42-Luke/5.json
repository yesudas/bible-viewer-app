If all of you will put your nets into the water, you will catch some fish.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"Simon answered, “Master, we worked hard all night trying to catch fish and caught nothing. But you say I should put the nets into the water, so I will.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"The fishermen put their nets into the water.

But how can I prove this to you? Maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven.’ There’s no proof that it really happened. But what if I say to the man, ‘Stand up and walk’? Then you will be able to see that I really have this power.” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, stand up! Take your mat and go home!”"},{"number":25,"verse":"The man immediately stood up in front of everyone.

I have come to ask sinners to change the way they live.”"},{"number":33,"verse":"(Jesus Is Not Like Other Religious Leaders) They said to Jesus, “John’s followers often fast and pray, the same as the followers of the Pharisees.
