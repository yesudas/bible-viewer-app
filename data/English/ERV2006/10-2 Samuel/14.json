My husband is dead."},{"number":6,"verse":"I had two sons. They were out in the field fighting. There was no one to stop them. One son killed the other son."},{"number":7,"verse":"Now the whole family is against me. They said to me, ‘Bring us the son who killed his brother and we will kill him, because he killed his brother.’ My son is like the last spark of a fire. If they kill my son, that fire will burn out and be finished. He is the only son left alive to get his father’s property.

No man in Israel was as handsome as Absalom.

If I have sinned, he can kill me!”"},{"number":33,"verse":"Absalom Visits King David Then Joab came to the king and told him what Absalom said. The king called for Absalom.
