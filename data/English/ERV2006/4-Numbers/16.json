Dathan, Abiram, and On were descendants of Reuben.)"},{"number":2,"verse":"These four men gathered 250 other men from Israel together and came against Moses. They were leaders who had been chosen by the people. All the people knew them."},{"number":3,"verse":"They came as a group to speak against Moses and Aaron and said, “You have gone too far—you are wrong! All the Israelites are holy—the LORD still lives among them. You are making yourselves more important than the rest of the LORD’s people.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"When Moses heard this, he bowed his face to the ground to show he was not being proud."},{"number":5,"verse":"Then Moses said to Korah and all his followers, “Tomorrow morning the LORD will show who belongs to him. He will show who is holy, and he will bring that man near to him. He will choose him and bring that man near to him."},{"number":6,"verse":"So Korah, you and all your followers should do this:"},{"number":7,"verse":"Tomorrow put fire and incense in some special pans.

We will not come.”"},{"number":15,"verse":"So Moses became very angry. He said to the LORD, “I never did anything wrong to these people. I never took anything from them—not even a donkey! Don’t accept their gifts!”"},{"number":16,"verse":"Then Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers will stand before the LORD tomorrow. Aaron will also be there with you and your followers."},{"number":17,"verse":"Each of you must bring a pan, put incense in it, and present it to the LORD.

They stood outside of their tents with their wives, children, and little babies."},{"number":28,"verse":"Then Moses said, “I will show you proof that the LORD sent me to do all the things I told you. I will show you that all these things were not my own idea."},{"number":29,"verse":"These men will die, but if they die in a normal way—the way people always die—then that will show that the LORD did not really send me."},{"number":30,"verse":"But if the LORD causes them to die in a different way, then you will know that these men have sinned against the LORD. This is the proof: The earth will open and swallow them. They will go down to their grave still alive. And everything that belongs to these men will go down with them.”"},{"number":31,"verse":"When Moses finished saying these things, the ground under the men opened."},{"number":32,"verse":"It was as if the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them. All of Korah’s men, their families, and everything they owned went down into the earth."},{"number":33,"verse":"They went down into their grave alive. Everything they owned went with them. Then the earth closed over them. They were finished—gone from the camp!"},{"number":34,"verse":"The Israelites heard the cries of the men being destroyed.

Tell him to scatter the coals and ashes. These men sinned against me, and their sin cost them their lives. But the incense pans are still holy. The pans became holy when people gave them to the LORD. Hammer the pans into flat sheets. Use the metal sheets to cover the altar. This will be a warning to all the Israelites.”"},{"number":39,"verse":"So Eleazar the priest gathered together all the bronze pans that the men had brought. These men were all burned up, but the pans were still there. Then Eleazar told some men to hammer the pans into flat metal. Then he put the metal sheets on the altar."},{"number":40,"verse":"He did this the way the LORD commanded him through Moses. This was a sign to help the Israelites remember that only someone from the family of Aaron should burn incense before the LORD. Any other person who burns incense before the Lord will die like Korah and his followers."},{"number":41,"verse":"Aaron Saves the People The next day all the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron. They said, “You killed the LORD’s people.”"},{"number":42,"verse":"Moses and Aaron were standing at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.

The trouble has already started.”"},{"number":47,"verse":"[47-48] So Aaron got the incense and the fire, and he ran to the middle of the people. But the sickness had already started among them. So Aaron stood between the dead and those who were still alive. He did what Moses said to remove their sin, and the sickness stopped there."},{"number":49,"verse":"But 14700 people died from that sickness—and that is not counting the people who died because of Korah."},{"number":50,"verse":"So the terrible sickness was stopped, and Aaron went back to Moses at the entrance of the Meeting Tent."}]}
