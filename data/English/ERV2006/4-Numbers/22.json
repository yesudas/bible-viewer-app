Balaam was at Pethor, near the Euphrates River. This was where Balaam’s people lived.

They have camped next to me."},{"number":6,"verse":"Come and help me. These people are too powerful for me. I know that you have great power. If you bless people, good things happen to them. And if you curse people, bad things happen to them. So come and curse these people. Maybe then I will be able to defeat them and force them to leave my country.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"The leaders of Moab and Midian left. They went to talk to Balaam. They carried with them money to pay him for his service. (for his service Or “for the things he needed to make curses.” In ancient times, when people asked bad things to happen to other people, they often wrote the curses on special bowls and used them in ceremonies. They did this to try to force these bad things to happen. See Deut. 18:10.) Then they told him what Balak had said."},{"number":8,"verse":"Balaam said to them, “Stay here for the night.

The LORD will not let me go with you.”"},{"number":14,"verse":"So the leaders of Moab went back to Balak and told him this. They said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”"},{"number":15,"verse":"So Balak sent other leaders to Balaam. This time he sent many more than the first time.

Come and curse these people for me.”"},{"number":18,"verse":"Balaam gave Balak’s officials his answer. He said, “I must obey the LORD my God.

Balaam could not see the angel, so he was very angry at the donkey. He hit the donkey and forced it to go back on the road."},{"number":24,"verse":"Later, the LORD’s angel stood at a place where the road became narrow. This was between two vineyards. There were walls on both sides of the road."},{"number":25,"verse":"Again the donkey saw the LORD’s angel. So the donkey walked very close to one wall. This crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So Balaam hit his donkey again."},{"number":26,"verse":"Later, the LORD’s angel stood at another place where the road became narrow. There was no place where the donkey could go around him. It could not turn to the left or to the right."},{"number":27,"verse":"The donkey saw the LORD’s angel. So the donkey lay down with Balaam sitting on top of it. Balaam was very angry at the donkey.

If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!”"},{"number":30,"verse":"But the donkey said to Balaam, “Look, I am your donkey. You have ridden me for so many years.

Balaam bowed low to the ground."},{"number":32,"verse":"Then the LORD’s angel asked Balaam, “Why did you hit your donkey three times? I am the one who came to stop you. But just in time, (But just in time Or “You should not be going this way,” or “You are not doing right.” The Hebrew text here is hard to understand.)"},{"number":33,"verse":"your donkey saw me and turned away from me. That happened three times. If the donkey had not turned away, I probably would have killed you already. And I would have let your donkey live.”"},{"number":34,"verse":"Then Balaam said to the LORD’s angel, “I have sinned. I did not know that you were standing in the road. If I am doing wrong, I will go back home.”"},{"number":35,"verse":"Then the LORD’s angel said to Balaam, “No, you can go with these men. But be careful. Speak only the words that I will tell you to say.” So Balaam went with the leaders that Balak had sent."},{"number":36,"verse":"Balak heard that Balaam was coming. So Balak went out to meet him at the Moabite town (Moabite town Or possibly, “Ar Moab.”) near the Arnon River. This was at the northern border of his country."},{"number":37,"verse":"When Balak saw Balaam, he said to him, “I asked you before to come. I told you it was very important.
