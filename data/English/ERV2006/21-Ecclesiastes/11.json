If a tree falls—to the south or to the north—then it will stay where it falls."},{"number":4,"verse":"But there are some things that you cannot be sure of. You must take a chance. If you wait for perfect weather, you will never plant your seeds.

(Don’t let … sin Or “Don’t worry about things. Protect yourself from troubles.”) People do foolish things in the dawn of life while they are young."}]}
