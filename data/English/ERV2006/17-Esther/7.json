Ask anything and it will be given to you. What do you want? I will give you anything, even half my kingdom.”"},{"number":3,"verse":"Then Queen Esther answered, “King, if you like me and it pleases you, please let me live. And I ask you to let my people live too. This is what I ask for."},{"number":4,"verse":"I ask this because my people and I have been sold to be destroyed—to be killed and wiped out completely. If we had just been sold as slaves, I would have kept quiet, because that would not be enough of a problem to bother the king.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"Then King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, “Who did this to you?
