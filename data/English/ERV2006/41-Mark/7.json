They do this to follow the traditions they have from their great leaders who lived long ago."},{"number":4,"verse":"And when these Jews buy something in the market, they never eat it until they wash it in a special way. They also follow other rules from their people who lived before them. They follow rules like the washing of cups, pitchers, and pots. (pots Some Greek copies add “and couches.”)"},{"number":5,"verse":"The Pharisees and teachers of the law said to Jesus, “Your followers don’t follow the traditions we have from our great leaders who lived long ago. They eat their food with hands that are not clean. Why do they do this?”"},{"number":6,"verse":"Jesus answered, “You are all hypocrites. Isaiah was right when he wrote these words from God about you: ‘These people honor me with their words, but I am not really important to them."},{"number":7,"verse":"Their worship of me is worthless.

He said, “Everyone should listen to me and understand what I am saying."},{"number":15,"verse":"There is nothing people can put in their mouth that will make them wrong.

Surely you know that nothing that enters the mouth from the outside can make people unacceptable to God."},{"number":19,"verse":"Food does not go into a person’s mind. It goes into the stomach.

And these are the things that make people unacceptable to God.”"},{"number":24,"verse":"(Jesus Helps a Non-Jewish Woman) Jesus went from there to the area around Tyre. He did not want the people in that area to know he was there, so he went into a house. But he could not stay hidden."},{"number":25,"verse":"A woman heard that he was there. Her little daughter had an evil spirit inside her. So the woman came to Jesus and bowed down near his feet."},{"number":26,"verse":"She was not a Jew. She was born in Phoenicia, an area in Syria. She begged Jesus to force the demon out of her daughter."},{"number":27,"verse":"Jesus told the woman, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and give it to the dogs. First let the children eat all they want.”"},{"number":28,"verse":"She answered, “That is true, Lord. But the dogs under the table can eat the pieces of food that the children don’t eat.”"},{"number":29,"verse":"Then he told her, “That is a very good answer. You may go.
