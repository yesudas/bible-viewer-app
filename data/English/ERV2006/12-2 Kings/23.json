But Josiah stopped those false priests."},{"number":6,"verse":"Josiah removed the Asherah pole from the LORD’s Temple.

Women also used these houses and made little tent covers to honor the false goddess Asherah."},{"number":8,"verse":"[8-9] At that time the priests did not bring the sacrifices to Jerusalem and offer them on the LORD’s altar in the Temple. The priests lived in cities all over Judah. They burned incense and offered sacrifices at the high places in those cities. The high places were everywhere, from Geba to Beersheba. And the priests ate their unleavened bread in those towns with the ordinary people—not at the special place for priests in the Temple in Jerusalem.
