(Most Holy Place Literally, “holies” for “holy of holies,” the spiritual place where God lives and is worshiped.) He serves in the true place of worship (place of worship Literally, “Tabernacle” or “tent.”) that was made by God, not by anyone here on earth."},{"number":3,"verse":"Every high priest has the work of offering gifts and sacrifices to God. So our high priest must also offer something to God."},{"number":4,"verse":"If our high priest were now living on earth, he would not be a priest. I say this because there are already priests here who follow the law by offering gifts to God."},{"number":5,"verse":"The work that these priests do is really only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven. That is why God warned Moses when he was ready to build the Holy Tent: “Be sure to make everything exactly like the pattern I showed you on the mountain.” (Quote from Ex. 25:40.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"But the work that has been given to Jesus is much greater than the work that was given to those priests. In the same way, the new agreement that Jesus brought from God to his people is much greater than the old one. And the new agreement is based on better promises."},{"number":7,"verse":"If there was nothing wrong with the first agreement, then there would be no need for a second agreement."},{"number":8,"verse":"But God found something wrong with the people. He said, “The time is coming, says the Lord, when I will give a new agreement to the people of Israel and to the people of Judah."},{"number":9,"verse":"It will not be like the agreement that I gave to their fathers. That is the agreement I gave when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. They did not continue following the agreement I gave them, and I turned away from them, says the Lord."},{"number":10,"verse":"This is the new agreement I will give the people of Israel. I will give this agreement in the future, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their minds, and I will write my laws on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people."},{"number":11,"verse":"Never again will anyone have to teach their neighbors or their family to know the Lord. All people—the greatest and the least important—will know me."},{"number":12,"verse":"And I will forgive the wrongs they have done, and I will not remember their sins.” (Cross references: : Jeremiah 31:31-34)"},{"number":13,"verse":"God called this a new agreement, so he has made the first agreement old. And anything that is old and useless is ready to disappear."}]}
