We should remove from our lives anything that would slow us down and the sin that so often makes us fall."},{"number":2,"verse":"We must never stop looking to Jesus. He is the leader of our faith, and he is the one who makes our faith complete. He suffered death on a cross.

Someone like that can ruin your whole group."},{"number":16,"verse":"Be careful that no one commits sexual sin. And be careful that no one is like Esau and never thinks about God. As the oldest son, Esau would have inherited everything from his father.

You have come to the sprinkled blood (sprinkled blood The blood (death) of Jesus.) that tells us about better things than the blood of Abel."},{"number":25,"verse":"Be careful and don’t refuse to listen when God speaks. Those people refused to listen to him when he warned them on earth. And they did not escape. Now God is speaking from heaven. So now it will be worse for those who refuse to listen to him."},{"number":26,"verse":"When he spoke before, his voice shook the earth.
