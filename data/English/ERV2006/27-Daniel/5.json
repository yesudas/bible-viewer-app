In the days of your father, this man showed that he could understand secrets. He showed that he was very smart and very wise. He showed that he was like the gods in these things.

He ruled over all the men of magic and the Chaldeans."},{"number":12,"verse":"The man I am talking about is named Daniel. The king gave him the name Belteshazzar.

He learned that God Most High rules over human kingdoms, and he gives them to whoever he wants."},{"number":22,"verse":"“But Belshazzar, you already knew this. You are Nebuchadnezzar’s grandson, (grandson Or “son.” This does not necessarily mean they were from the same family.
