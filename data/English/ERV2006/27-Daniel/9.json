From the time that the message went out to go back and rebuild Jerusalem until the time for the chosen king (chosen king Literally, “anointed one.”) to come will be seven weeks.

God has ordered that place to be completely destroyed."},{"number":27,"verse":"“Then the future ruler will make an agreement with many people. That agreement will continue for one week. The offerings and sacrifices will stop for a half of a week. And a destroyer will come.
