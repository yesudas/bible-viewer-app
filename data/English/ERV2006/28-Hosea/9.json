Don’t be happy. You acted like a prostitute and left your God. You committed your sexual sin (You committed your sexual sin This means the people were not faithful to God.

There will not be enough wine for Israel."},{"number":3,"verse":"The Israelites will not stay in the LORD’s land. Ephraim will return to Egypt. In Assyria they will eat food that they should not eat."},{"number":4,"verse":"They will not be able to give offerings of wine to the LORD. None of their sacrifices will please him.

The time has come for you to pay for the evil things you did.” But the people of Israel say, “The prophet is a fool.

God will remember the Israelites’ sins, and he will punish them."},{"number":10,"verse":"(Israel Is Ruined by Its Worship of Idols) “At the time I, the Lord, found Israel, they were like fresh grapes in the desert. They were like the first figs on a fig tree at the beginning of the season. But when they came to Baal Peor, (Baal Peor This happened when Moses was still leading the Israelites in the desert. Read Num. 25:1-5.) they changed. So I had to cut them off like rotten fruit.
