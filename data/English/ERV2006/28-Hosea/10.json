But as Israel got more and more things, he built more and more altars to honor false gods. His land became better and better, so he put up better and better stones to honor false gods."},{"number":2,"verse":"The people of Israel tried to trick God, but now they must accept their guilt. He will break down their altars and destroy their memorial stones."},{"number":3,"verse":"The Evil Decisions of the Israelites Now the Israelites say, “We have no king. We don’t honor the LORD. And his king cannot do anything to us.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"They make promises, but they are only telling lies. They don’t keep their promises. They make agreements with other countries. God does not like those agreements. The judges are like poisonous weeds growing in a plowed field."},{"number":5,"verse":"The people from Samaria worship the calves at Beth Aven. (Beth Aven A name meaning “House of Evil.” It is a wordplay on the name “Bethel,” a name meaning “House of God.” There was a temple in this town.) They will cry. The priests will cry, because their beautiful idol is gone. It was carried away."},{"number":6,"verse":"It was carried away as a gift to the great king of Assyria. He will keep Ephraim’s shameful idol. Israel will be ashamed of its idol. (idol Or “advice.”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"Samaria’s false god (false god Or “king.”) will be destroyed. It will be like a piece of wood floating away on the water’s surface."},{"number":8,"verse":"Israel sinned and built many high places.

(And the people have continued to sin there.) Those evil people at Gibeah will be trapped by war."},{"number":10,"verse":"I will come to punish them.

(This probably refers to worship at Gibeah and Beth Aven.)"},{"number":11,"verse":"“Ephraim is like a trained young cow that loves to walk on grain on the threshing floor. I will put a good yoke on her neck. I will put the ropes on Ephraim. Then Judah will begin plowing.

You ate the fruit of your lies, because you had trusted in your power and your soldiers."},{"number":14,"verse":"So your armies will hear the noise of battle, and all your fortresses will be destroyed.
