He got a towel and wrapped it around his waist."},{"number":5,"verse":"Then he poured water into a bowl and began to wash the followers’ feet.

That is why he said, “Not all of you are clean.”"},{"number":12,"verse":"When Jesus finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and went back to the table. He asked, “Do you understand what I did for you?"},{"number":13,"verse":"You call me ‘Teacher.’ And you call me ‘Lord.’ And this is right, because that is what I am."},{"number":14,"verse":"I am your Lord and Teacher.

I know the people I have chosen. But what the Scriptures say must happen: ‘The man who shared my food has turned against me.’ (has turned against me Literally, “has lifted up his heel against me.” Quote from Ps. 41:9.)"},{"number":19,"verse":"I am telling you this now before it happens. Then when it happens, you will believe that I AM. (I Am This is like the name of God used in the Old Testament. See Isa. 41:4; 43:10; Ex. 3:14.

And whoever accepts me also accepts the one who sent me.”"},{"number":21,"verse":"Jesus Tells Who Will Turn Against Him After Jesus said these things, he felt very troubled.

Jesus said to Judas, “What you will do—do it quickly!”"},{"number":28,"verse":"No one at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas."},{"number":29,"verse":"Since Judas was the one in charge of the money, some of them thought that Jesus meant for him to go and buy some things they needed for the feast.
