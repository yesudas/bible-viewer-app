And you don’t know who I am, the one who asked you for a drink.

The well is very deep, and you have nothing to get water with."},{"number":12,"verse":"Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob? He is the one who gave us this well. He drank from it himself, and his sons and all his animals drank from it too.”"},{"number":13,"verse":"Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again."},{"number":14,"verse":"But anyone who drinks the water I give will never be thirsty again.

(prophet A prophet often knows things that are hidden to other people.)"},{"number":20,"verse":"Our fathers worshiped on this mountain.

The time is coming when you will not have to be in Jerusalem or on this mountain to worship the Father."},{"number":22,"verse":"You Samaritans worship something you don’t understand.

My food is to finish the work that he gave me to do."},{"number":35,"verse":"When you plant, you always say, ‘Four more months to wait before we gather the grain.’ But I tell you, open your eyes, and look at the fields. They are ready for harvesting now."},{"number":36,"verse":"Even now, the people who harvest the crop are being paid. They are gathering crops for eternal life. So now the people who plant can be happy together with those who harvest."},{"number":37,"verse":"It is true when we say, ‘One person plants, but another person harvests the crop.’"},{"number":38,"verse":"I sent you to harvest a crop that you did not work for. Others did the work, and you get the profit from their work.”"},{"number":39,"verse":"Many of the Samaritan people in that town believed in Jesus.

They had been at the Passover festival in Jerusalem and had seen everything he did there."},{"number":46,"verse":"Jesus went to visit Cana in Galilee again.
