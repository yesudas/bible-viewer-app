And the sweet smell from the perfume filled the whole house."},{"number":4,"verse":"Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus’ followers, was there—the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Judas said,"},{"number":5,"verse":"“That perfume was worth a full year’s pay. (a full year’s pay Literally, “300 denarii.” One Roman denarius, a silver coin, was the average pay for one day’s work.) It should have been sold, and the money should have been given to the poor people.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"But Judas did not really care about the poor. He said this because he was a thief.

I came so that everyone who believes in me will not stay in darkness."},{"number":47,"verse":"“I did not come into the world to judge people. I came to save the people in the world.
