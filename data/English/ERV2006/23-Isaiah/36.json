Sennacherib defeated those cities."},{"number":2,"verse":"He sent his commander with a large army to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. The commander and his army left Lachish and went to Jerusalem. They stopped near the aqueduct (aqueduct A ditch or pipe that carries water from one place to another. Here, this is the Shiloah, a channel that carried water from Gihon Spring to the Old Pool and the Pool of Siloam.) by the Upper Pool, (Upper Pool The Pool of Siloam at the southern tip of the City of David (Jerusalem), just above the older pool now called Birket al Hamrah.) on the street that leads up to Laundryman’s Field."},{"number":3,"verse":"Three men from Jerusalem went out to talk with the commander. These men were Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Joah son of Asaph, and Shebna.

Those are nothing but empty words. Now I ask you, who do you trust so much that you are willing to rebel against me?"},{"number":6,"verse":"Are you depending on Egypt to help you? Egypt is like a broken walking stick. If you lean on it for support, it will only stab you and hurt you.

(Hebrew Literally, “Judean,” the language of Judah and Israel.) We understand that language. Don’t speak to us in the language of Judah. If you use our language, the people on the city walls will understand you.”"},{"number":12,"verse":"But the commander said, “My master sent me to speak to everyone, not just to you and your master. I must also speak to those people sitting there on the wall. When we surround your city, they will suffer too. Like you, they will become so hungry they will eat their own waste and drink their own urine!”"},{"number":13,"verse":"Then the commander, shouting loudly in Hebrew, (Hebrew Literally, “Judean,” the language of Judah and Israel.) gave this warning to them all: Hear this message from the great king, the king of Assyria!"},{"number":14,"verse":"This is what the king says: Don’t let Hezekiah fool you!
