The LORD All-Powerful is his name."},{"number":3,"verse":"“Long ago I told you what would happen. I told you about these things. And suddenly I made them happen."},{"number":4,"verse":"I did that because I knew you were stubborn. You were like iron that will not bend, with heads as hard as bronze."},{"number":5,"verse":"So long ago I told you what would happen. I told you about those things long before they happened. I did this so that you could not say, ‘The gods we made did this. Our idols, our statues, made this happen.’”"},{"number":6,"verse":"(God Punishes Israel to Make Them Pure) “You heard what I said would happen. And you can see it has all been done. Shouldn’t you tell this to others? Now I will tell you about new things, secrets you have not known before."},{"number":7,"verse":"This is something that is happening now, not long ago.

And if I call them, they will come to stand before me."},{"number":14,"verse":"“All of you, come here and listen to me. Did any of the false gods say these things would happen? No!
