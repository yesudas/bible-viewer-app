So do you think you can build a house for me? Do I need a place to rest?"},{"number":2,"verse":"I am the one who made all things. They are all here because I made them,” says the LORD. “These are the people I care for: the poor, humble people who obey my commands."},{"number":3,"verse":"Some people kill bulls as a sacrifice, but they also beat people. They kill sheep as a sacrifice, but they also break the necks of dogs. They offer up grain offerings, but they also offer the blood of pigs. (dogs … pigs God did not want his people to offer dogs and pigs as sacrifices.) They burn incense, but they also love their worthless idols. They choose their own ways, and they love their terrible idols."},{"number":4,"verse":"So I decided to use their own tricks. I will punish them using what they are most afraid of.

A woman must feel the pain of childbirth before she can see the boy she gives birth to. Who ever heard of such a thing? In the same way, no one ever saw a new world begin in one day. No one has ever heard of a new nation that began in one day. But when Zion feels the pain, she will give birth to her children."},{"number":9,"verse":"In the same way, I will not cause pain without allowing something new to be born.” The LORD says this: “I promise that if I cause you the pain of birth, I will not stop you from having your new nation.” Your God said this."},{"number":10,"verse":"Jerusalem and all her friends, be happy!

But they will all be destroyed together."},{"number":18,"verse":"“They have evil thoughts and do evil things, so I am coming to punish them. I will gather all nations and all people. Everyone will be gathered together to see my Glory. (my Glory See “glory” in the Word List.)"},{"number":19,"verse":"I will put a mark on some of the people. I will send some of these saved people to the nations of Tarshish, Libya, (Libya A country in North Africa, west of Egypt.) Lud (Lud This country was probably in the country that is now western Turkey.) (the land of archers), Tubal, (Tubal This country was probably in what is now eastern Turkey.) Greece, and all the faraway lands. Those people have never heard my teachings. They have never seen my Glory. So the saved people will tell the nations about my glory."},{"number":20,"verse":"And they will bring all your brothers and sisters from those other nations to my holy mountain (my holy mountain This is probably Mount Zion, the mountain Jerusalem is built on.)
