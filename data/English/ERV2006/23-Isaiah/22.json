There are bodies lying everywhere, but they were not killed with swords. The people died, but not while fighting."},{"number":3,"verse":"All your officers ran away together, but they have all been captured without bows. (but they have … bows Or “but the archers captured them.”) All the leaders ran away together, but they were found and captured."},{"number":4,"verse":"So I say, “Don’t look at me! Let me cry! Don’t rush to comfort me about the destruction of Jerusalem.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"The Lord GOD All-Powerful chose a special day for there to be riots and confusion.

(Lower Pool The pool at the southern tip of the City of David, just below the Upper Pool (the Pool of Siloam).) You counted the houses and used stones from them to repair the walls. Then you built a pool between the double walls (pool between the double walls This is probably the Upper Pool (the Pool of Siloam).) for storing water from the Old Pool. (Old Pool Probably the pool at Gihon Spring on the eastern slopes of the city.) You did all this to protect yourselves, but you did not trust the God who made all these things. You did not even notice the one who made all these things so long ago."},{"number":12,"verse":"So the Lord GOD All-Powerful told the people to cry and mourn for their dead friends.

Why are you cutting a tomb out of this rock?"},{"number":17,"verse":"[17-18] “What a big man you are! But the LORD will crush you. He will roll you into a small ball and throw you far away into the open arms of another country, and there you will die. “You are very proud of your chariots.
