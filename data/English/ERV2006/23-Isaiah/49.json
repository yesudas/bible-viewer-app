{"bibleAbbr":"ERV2006","bookName":"Isaiah","bookEnglishName":"Isaiah","chapterNumber":49,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"(God Calls His Special Servant) Hear me, people by the sea. Listen to me, you faraway nations. The LORD called me before I was born. He called my name while I was still in my mother’s womb."},{"number":2,"verse":"He used me to speak for him. He used me like a sharp sword, but he also held me in his hand to protect me.

I will do wonderful things with you.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"I said, “I worked hard for nothing. I wore myself out, but I did nothing useful. I used all my power, but I did not really do anything.

You will show people all over the world the way to be saved.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"The LORD, the Holy Protector of Israel, speaks to his servant. People hate that servant. Nations despise him.

Where did all these children come from?’”"},{"number":22,"verse":"This is what the Lord GOD says: “Look, I will wave my hand to the nations. I will raise my flag for everyone to see. Then they will bring your children to you. They will carry your children on their shoulders, and they will hold them in their arms."},{"number":23,"verse":"Kings will be their teachers.

Then you will know that I am the LORD, and anyone who trusts in me will not be disappointed.”"},{"number":24,"verse":"If a strong soldier takes a prisoner, can you set him free? If a powerful soldier guards someone, can the prisoner escape?"},{"number":25,"verse":"Here is the LORD’s answer: “The prisoners will escape. Those captured by the strong soldier will be set free. That’s because I will fight your battles, and I will save your children."},{"number":26,"verse":"Those people hurt you, but I will force them to eat their own bodies.
