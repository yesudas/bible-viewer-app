You will not be embarrassed. When you were young, you felt shame. But you will forget that shame now. You will not remember the shame you felt when you lost your husband. (husband In Hebrew this word is like the name Baal. This means that the LORD is Jerusalem’s true God, not the false god Baal.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"Your real husband is the one who made you. His name is the LORD All-Powerful. The Holy One of Israel is your Protector, (Protector Or “Redeemer,” someone who cared for and protected the family of a dead relative.
