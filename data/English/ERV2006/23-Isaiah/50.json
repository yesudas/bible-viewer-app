Your mother was sent away because of the bad things you did."},{"number":2,"verse":"I came home and found no one there. I called and called, but no one answered. Do you think I cannot get you back? Do you think I cannot save you? Look, if I gave the command, the ocean would dry up! I can turn rivers into a desert.
