Listen to me!"},{"number":2,"verse":"I am the LORD, and I made you. I am the one who created you. I have helped you since you were in your mother’s womb. Jacob, my servant, don’t be afraid. Jeshurun, (Jeshurun Another name for Israel. It means “good” or “honest.”) I chose you."},{"number":3,"verse":"“I will pour water for thirsty people, and streams will flow through the desert. I will pour my Spirit on your children, and I will bless (bless This is a wordplay. This Hebrew word sounds like the word meaning “pool.”) your family."},{"number":4,"verse":"They will sprout like grass in the spring and grow like trees by streams of water."},{"number":5,"verse":"“One man will call himself, ‘I am the LORD’s.’ Another will use the name, ‘Jacob.’ Another man will sign his name as ‘The LORD’s Hand.’ And another will use the name, ‘Israel.’”"},{"number":6,"verse":"The LORD is the king of Israel.

I am the Beginning and the End."},{"number":7,"verse":"There is no other God like me. If there is, that god should speak now.

He uses his own powerful arms, but when he gets hungry, he loses his strength.

It was used to make straight lines on wood or stone.) and compass (compass A tool used to draw circles and copy measurements.) to draw lines on the wood to show where he should cut. Then he uses his chisels (chisels Sharp tools used to carve wood or stone.) and cuts a statue from the wood. He uses his calipers (calipers A special measuring tool, like a compass.) to measure the statue. In this way the worker makes the wood look exactly like a man, and this statue of a man does nothing but sit in the house."},{"number":14,"verse":"To split the cedar tree, the worker took some oak or cypress wedges. To make sure he had plenty of wood, he planted some pines. But it was the rain that made them grow."},{"number":15,"verse":"When the man wanted a fire, he took some of the wood to keep him warm. He also used some of it to bake his bread. But then he used that same wood to make a statue to worship as a god! That god is only a statue that he made, but he bows down to it!"},{"number":16,"verse":"He burns half of the wood in the fire.

It is as if they have mud in their eyes so they cannot see. Their minds cannot understand."},{"number":19,"verse":"They don’t realize what they are doing. They aren’t smart enough to think, “I burned half of the wood in the fire. I used the hot coals to bake my bread and cook the meat I ate. And I used the wood that was left to make this terrible thing. I am worshiping a block of wood!”"},{"number":20,"verse":"Someone like that is deceived. They don’t know what they are doing. (They … doing Literally, “They eat ashes.”) They cannot save themselves, and they will not admit, “This statue I am holding is a lie!”"},{"number":21,"verse":"The Lord, the True God, Helps Israel “Jacob, remember these things! Israel, remember, you are my servant. I made you, and you are my servant. So, Israel, don’t forget me."},{"number":22,"verse":"Your sins were like a big cloud, but I wiped them all away.
