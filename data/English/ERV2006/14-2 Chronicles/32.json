He made many weapons and shields."},{"number":6,"verse":"[6-7] Hezekiah chose officers of war to be in charge of the people. He met with these officers at the open place near the city gate.

There is a greater power with us than the king of Assyria has with him!"},{"number":8,"verse":"The king of Assyria only has men. But we have the LORD our God with us! Our God will help us.

The gods of the other countries could not save their people. Those gods could not stop me from destroying their people."},{"number":14,"verse":"My ancestors destroyed those countries. There is no god that can stop me from destroying his people. So you think your god can save you from me?"},{"number":15,"verse":"Don’t let Hezekiah fool you or trick you.
