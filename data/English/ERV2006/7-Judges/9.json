They said, “After all, he is our brother.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"So the leaders of Shechem gave Abimelech 70 pieces of silver. That silver was from the temple of the god Baal Berith. Abimelech used the silver to hire some men. These men were worthless, reckless men. They followed Abimelech wherever he went."},{"number":5,"verse":"Abimelech went to his father’s house at Ophrah and murdered his brothers. He killed the 70 sons of his father Gideon. He killed them all at the same time, (all at the same time Literally, “on one stone.” Also in verse 18.) but Gideon’s youngest son hid from Abimelech and escaped. The youngest son’s name was Jotham."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then all the leaders in Shechem and the house of Millo (Millo This was probably a well-protected part of the city, perhaps even the palace area.

Everyone gathered beside the big tree of the pillar in Shechem and made Abimelech their king."},{"number":7,"verse":"Jotham’s Story Jotham heard that the leaders of the city of Shechem had made Abimelech king.

Then let God listen to you."},{"number":8,"verse":"“One day the trees decided to choose a king to rule over them.

But if you don’t want to do this, let fire come out of the thornbush. Let the fire burn even the cedar trees of Lebanon.’"},{"number":16,"verse":"“Now if you were completely honest when you made Abimelech king, may you be happy with him.

He fought for you and risked his life when he saved you from the Midianites."},{"number":18,"verse":"But now you have turned against my father’s family. You have killed 70 of his sons all at the same time. You made Abimelech the new king over the city of Shechem. He is only the son of my father’s slave girl.

And may he be happy with you."},{"number":20,"verse":"But leaders of Shechem and the house of Millo, (house of Millo Or “Royal Family of Millo.”) if you have not acted right, may Abimelech destroy you.

He stayed there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech."},{"number":22,"verse":"Abimelech Fights Against Shechem Abimelech ruled the Israelites for three years."},{"number":23,"verse":"[23-24] Abimelech had killed Gideon’s 70 sons—and they were his own brothers.

And they began planning ways to hurt Abimelech."},{"number":25,"verse":"The leaders of the city of Shechem did not like Abimelech anymore. They put men on the hilltops to attack and rob everyone who went by.

The leaders of the city of Shechem decided to trust and follow Gaal."},{"number":27,"verse":"One day the people of Shechem went out to the vineyards to pick grapes. They squeezed the grapes to make wine. And then they had a party at the temple of their god. The people ate and drank and cursed Abimelech."},{"number":28,"verse":"Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “We are the men of Shechem. Why should we obey Abimelech? Who does he think he is? Abimelech is one of Gideon’s sons, right? And Abimelech made Zebul his officer, right? We should not obey Abimelech. We should follow our own people, men from Hamor. (men from Hamor This refers to native born citizens of Shechem. Hamor was the father of Shechem in a story in Gen. 34. The city of Shechem is said to have been named after Hamor’s son.)

(in the city of Arumah Or “secretly” or “in Tormah,” the town where Abimelech lived as king. It was probably about eight miles south of Shechem.)

They hid near the city of Shechem."},{"number":35,"verse":"Gaal son of Ebed went out and was standing at the entrance to the gate of the city of Shechem. While Gaal was standing there, Abimelech and his soldiers came out of their hiding places."},{"number":36,"verse":"When Gaal saw the soldiers, he said to Zebul, “Look, there are people coming down from the mountains.” But Zebul said, “You are only seeing the shadows of the mountains. The shadows just look like people.”"},{"number":37,"verse":"But again Gaal said, “Look, there are some people coming down from that place over there by Land’s Navel. And there! I saw someone’s head over by Magician’s Tree. (Land’s Navel … Magician’s Tree Two places in the hills near Shechem.) ”"},{"number":38,"verse":"Zebul said to Gaal, “Why aren’t you bragging now? You said, ‘Who is Abimelech? Why should we obey him?’ You made fun of these men. Now go out and fight them.”"},{"number":39,"verse":"So Gaal led the leaders of Shechem out to fight Abimelech."},{"number":40,"verse":"Abimelech and his men chased Gaal and his men.

Abimelech found out about it."},{"number":43,"verse":"So Abimelech separated his men into three groups. He wanted to attack the people of Shechem by surprise. So he hid his men in the fields.

The other two groups ran out to the people in the fields and killed them."},{"number":45,"verse":"Abimelech and his men fought against the city of Shechem all that day. They captured the city of Shechem and killed its people. Then Abimelech tore down the city and threw salt over the ruins."},{"number":46,"verse":"There were some people who lived at the Tower of Shechem. (Tower of Shechem This was probably a place near Shechem but not actually part of the city.) When they heard what had happened to Shechem, they gathered together in the safest room (safest room The meaning of this Hebrew word is uncertain. Also in verse 49.) of the temple of the god El Berith. (El Berith Another name for the god Baal Berith mentioned in verses 4 and 8:33.

Then Abimelech said to the men with him, “Hurry! Do the same thing that I have done.”"},{"number":49,"verse":"So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelech.

Abimelech went up to the door of the tower to burn it."},{"number":53,"verse":"But, while Abimelech was standing at the door of the tower, a woman on the roof dropped a grinding stone on his head. The grinding stone crushed his skull."},{"number":54,"verse":"Abimelech quickly said to the servant who carried his weapons, “Take out your sword and kill me.

So the things said by Jotham son of Gideon came true."}]}
