They want houses, so they take them. They cheat a man and take his house and his land."},{"number":3,"verse":"The Lord’s Plans to Punish the People That is why the LORD says: “Look, I am planning trouble against this family. You will not be able to save yourselves. (save yourselves Literally, “take your necks off it.”) You will stop being proud, because bad times are coming."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then people will sing songs about you.
