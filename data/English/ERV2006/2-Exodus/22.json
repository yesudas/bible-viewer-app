It doesn’t matter if the animal was a bull, a donkey, or a sheep. “If a thief is killed while trying to break into a house at night, then no one will be guilty for killing him. But if this happens during the day, the one who killed him will be guilty of murder."},{"number":5,"verse":"“A man might let his animal loose to graze in his field or vineyard. If the animal wanders into another person’s field or vineyard, then the owner must pay. The payment must come from the best of his crop. (Or “A man might start a fire in his field or vineyard. If he lets the fire spread and it burns his neighbor’s field or vineyard, he must use his best crops to pay his neighbor for his loss.”)"},{"number":6,"verse":"“A man might start a fire to burn thornbushes on his field.

One man says, ‘This is mine,’ and the other says, ‘No, it is mine.’ Both men should go before the judges who will decide who is guilty. The one who was wrong must pay the other man twice as much as the thing is worth."},{"number":10,"verse":"“A man might ask his neighbor to take care of an animal for a short time.

The neighbor will not have to pay the owner for the animal that was killed."},{"number":14,"verse":"“If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor, and the animal is hurt or dies, then the neighbor must pay the owner for the animal. The neighbor is responsible, because the owner was not there himself."},{"number":15,"verse":"But if the owner was there, then the neighbor does not have to pay. Or if the neighbor was paying money to use the animal for work, he will not have to pay if the animal dies or is hurt. The money he paid to use the animal will be enough payment."},{"number":16,"verse":"“If a man has sexual relations with a virgin who he is not engaged to, (a virgin … engaged to Literally, “a virgin who is not engaged.”) then he must pay her father the full amount necessary to marry her."},{"number":17,"verse":"If the father refuses to allow his daughter to marry him, then the man must still pay the full amount for her."},{"number":18,"verse":"“You must not allow any woman to do evil magic. If she does magic, you must not let her live."},{"number":19,"verse":"“You must not allow anyone to have sexual relations with an animal. If this happens, that person must be killed."},{"number":20,"verse":"“Whoever makes a sacrifice to a false god should be destroyed.
