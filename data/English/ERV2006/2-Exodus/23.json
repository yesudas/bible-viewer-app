If you are a witness in court, don’t agree to help a bad person tell lies."},{"number":2,"verse":"“Don’t do something just because everyone else is doing it. If you see a group of people doing wrong, don’t join them. You must not let them persuade you to do wrong things—you must do what is right and fair."},{"number":3,"verse":"“In court, don’t treat a person in a special way simply because that person is poor."},{"number":4,"verse":"“If you see a lost bull or donkey, then you must return it to its owner—even if the owner is your enemy."},{"number":5,"verse":"“If you see an animal that cannot walk because it has too much to carry, you must stop and help that animal.

You must come to my special place to worship me during these festivals."},{"number":15,"verse":"The first festival is the Festival of Unleavened Bread. This is as I commanded you.

Everyone must bring a sacrifice to me at that time."},{"number":16,"verse":"“The second festival will be the Festival of Harvest. This festival will be during the early summer when you begin harvesting the first crops that you planted in your fields. “The third festival will be the Festival of Shelters.

He will lead you against many different people—the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites. But I will defeat all of them."},{"number":24,"verse":"“Don’t worship their gods. Don’t ever bow down to those gods. You must never live the way those people live. You must destroy their idols. And you must break the stones that help them remember their gods. (stones … gods Or “memorials.” Here, these were stone markers that people used in worshiping their gods.)"},{"number":25,"verse":"You must serve the LORD your God. If you do this, I will bless you with plenty of bread and water. I will take away all sickness from you."},{"number":26,"verse":"Your women will all be able to have babies. None of their babies will die at birth. And I will allow you to live long lives."},{"number":27,"verse":"“When you fight against your enemies, I will send my great power before you.

The Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites will leave your country."},{"number":29,"verse":"But I will not force all of them out of your land quickly. I will not do this in only one year. The land will be empty if I force the people out too fast. Then all the wild animals would increase and control the land. And they would be much trouble for you."},{"number":30,"verse":"So I will force them out of your land very slowly. I will do this as you grow and eventually take the land to be your own."},{"number":31,"verse":"“I will give you all the land from the Red Sea (Red Sea Or “Reed Sea,” probably the part known as the Gulf of Aqaba. See 1 Kings 9:26.) to the Mediterranean Sea, (Mediterranean Sea Literally, “Philistine Sea.”) and from the desert of Sinai to the Euphrates River. I will let you defeat the people living there and force them all to leave."},{"number":32,"verse":"“You must not make any agreements with any of those people or their gods."},{"number":33,"verse":"Don’t let them stay in your country. If you let them stay, they will be like a trap to you—they will cause you to sin against me. And you will begin worshiping their gods.”"}]}
