They said, “He is a god!”"},{"number":7,"verse":"There were some fields around that same area. They were owned by a man named Publius, the most important Roman official on the island. He welcomed us into his home and was very good to us. We stayed in his house for three days."},{"number":8,"verse":"Publius’ father was very sick.

So they wanted to let me go free."},{"number":19,"verse":"But the Jews there did not want that. So I had to ask to come to Rome to have my trial before Caesar.

You will look and you will see, but you will not understand what you see."},{"number":27,"verse":"Yes, the minds of these people are now closed. They have ears, but they don’t listen.
