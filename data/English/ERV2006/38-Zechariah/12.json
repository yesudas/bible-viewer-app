And this is what the LORD said:"},{"number":2,"verse":"“Look, I will make Jerusalem like a cup of poison to the nations around her. The nations will come and attack that city, and all of Judah will be caught in the trap."},{"number":3,"verse":"But I will make Jerusalem like a heavy rock—those who try to take it will hurt themselves. They will be cut and scratched. All the nations on earth will come together to fight against Jerusalem."},{"number":4,"verse":"But at that time I will scare the horse, and the soldier riding it will panic. I will make all the enemy horses blind, but my eyes will be open—and I will be watching over Judah’s family."},{"number":5,"verse":"The leaders of Judah will encourage the people and say, ‘The LORD All-Powerful is your God. He makes us strong.’"},{"number":6,"verse":"At that time I will make the leaders of Judah like a fire burning in a forest. They will destroy their enemies like fire burning straw. They will destroy the enemy all around them, and the people in Jerusalem will again be able to sit back and relax.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"The LORD will save the people of Judah first, so the people in Jerusalem will not be able to brag too much.

The men in Simeon’s family will cry by themselves, and their wives will cry by themselves."},{"number":14,"verse":"And the same thing will happen in all the other tribes. The men and women will cry by themselves.”"}]}
