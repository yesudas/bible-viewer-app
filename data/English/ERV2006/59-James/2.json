At the same time a poor person comes in wearing old, dirty clothes."},{"number":3,"verse":"You show special attention to the person wearing nice clothes. You say, “Sit here in this good seat.” But you say to the poor person, “Stand there!” or “Sit on the floor by our feet!”"},{"number":4,"verse":"Doesn’t this show that you think some people are more important than others? You set yourselves up as judges—judges who make bad decisions."},{"number":5,"verse":"Listen, my dear brothers and sisters. God chose the poor people in the world to be rich in faith. He chose them to receive the kingdom God promised to those who love him."},{"number":6,"verse":"But you show no respect to those who are poor.

I hope you stay warm and get plenty to eat,” but you don’t give them the things they need. If you don’t help them, your words are worthless."},{"number":17,"verse":"It is the same with faith. If it is just faith and nothing more—if it doesn’t do anything—it is dead."},{"number":18,"verse":"But someone might argue, “Some people have faith, and others have good works.” My answer would be that you can’t show me your faith if you don’t do anything.

Abraham was called “God’s friend.” (Quote from 2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8.)"},{"number":24,"verse":"So you see that people are made right with God by what they do. They cannot be made right by faith alone."},{"number":25,"verse":"Another example is Rahab. She was a prostitute, but she was made right with God by something she did. She helped those who were spying for God’s people. She welcomed them into her home and helped them escape by a different road.
