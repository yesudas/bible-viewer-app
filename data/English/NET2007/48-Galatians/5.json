(tn Or “make eunuchs of themselves”; Grk “cut themselves off.” This statement is rhetorical hyperbole on Paul’s part. It does strongly suggest, however, that Paul’s adversaries in this case (“those agitators”) were men. Some interpreters (notably Erasmus and the Reformers) have attempted to soften the meaning to a figurative “separate themselves” (meaning the opponents would withdraw from fellowship) but such an understanding dramatically weakens the rhetorical force of Paul’s argument. Although it has been argued that such an act of emasculation would be unthinkable for Paul, it must be noted that Paul’s statement is one of biting sarcasm, obviously not meant to be taken literally.

Stählin, TDNT 3:853-55.)"},{"number":13,"verse":"Practice Love For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; (tn Grk “brothers.” See note on the phrase “brothers and sisters” in 1:11.) only do not use your freedom as an opportunity to indulge your flesh, (tn Grk “as an opportunity for the flesh”; BDAG 915 s. v. σάρξ 2. c. α states: “In Paul’s thought esp., all parts of the body constitute a totality known as σ. or flesh, which is dominated by sin to such a degree that wherever flesh is, all forms of sin are likew. present, and no good thing can live in the σάρξ…Gal 5:13, 24;…Opp. τὸ πνεῦμα…Gal 3:3; 5:16, 17ab; 6:8ab.”) but through love serve one another.
