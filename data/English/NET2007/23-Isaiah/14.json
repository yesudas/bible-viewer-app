The present translation understands the referent of the pronoun (“it”) to be the “club/scepter” of the preceding line.) furiously struck down nations with unceasing blows. (tn Heb “it was striking down nations in fury [with] a blow without ceasing.” The participle (“striking down”) suggests repeated or continuous action in past time.) It angrily ruled over nations, oppressing them without restraint.

(tn The Hebrew text has הֵילֵל בֶּן־שָׁחַר (helel ben-shakhar, “Helel son of Shachar”), which is probably a name for the morning star (Venus) or the crescent moon. See HALOT 245 s. v. הֵילֵל. sn What is the background for the imagery in vv. 12–15? This whole section (vv. 4b–21) is directed to the king of Babylon, who is clearly depicted as a human ruler. Other kings of the earth address him in vv. 9ff., he is called “the man” in v. 16, and, according to vv. 19–20, he possesses a physical body. Nevertheless the language of vv. 12–15 has led some to see a dual referent in the taunt song. These verses, which appear to be spoken by other pagan kings to a pagan king (cf. vv. 9–11), contain several titles and motifs that resemble those of Canaanite mythology, including references to Helel son of Shachar, the stars of El, the mountain of assembly, the recesses of Zaphon, and the divine title Most High. Apparently these verses allude to a mythological story about a minor god (Helel son of Shachar) who tried to take over Zaphon, the mountain of the gods. His attempted coup failed and he was hurled down to the underworld. The king of Babylon is taunted for having similar unrealized delusions of grandeur. Some Christians have seen an allusion to the fall of Satan here, but this seems contextually unwarranted (see J. Martin, “Isaiah,” BKCOT, 1061).) You have been cut down to the ground, O conqueror (tn Some understand the verb to from חָלַשׁ (khalash, “to weaken”), but HALOT 324 s. v. II חלשׁ proposes a homonym here, meaning “to defeat.”) of the nations! (sn In this line the taunting kings hint at the literal identity of the king, after likening him to the god Helel and a tree.

Above the stars of El (sn In Canaanite mythology the stars of El were astral deities under the authority of the high god El.) I will set up my throne. I will rule on the mountain of assembly on the remote slopes of Zaphon. (sn Zaphon, the Canaanite version of Olympus, was the “mountain of assembly” where the gods met.)"},{"number":14,"verse":"I will climb up to the tops (tn Heb “the high places.” This word often refers to the high places where pagan worship was conducted, but here it probably refers to the “backs” or tops of the clouds. See HALOT 136 s. v. בָּמָה.) of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High!” (sn Normally in the OT the title “Most High” belongs to the God of Israel, but in this context, where the mythological overtones are so strong, it probably refers to the Canaanite high god El.)"},{"number":15,"verse":"But you were brought down (tn The prefixed verb form is taken as a preterite. Note the use of perfects in v. 12 to describe the king’s downfall.) to Sheol, to the remote slopes of the pit.

This emendation may be unnecessary in light of other examples of lack of agreement a suffix and its antecedent noun.) cities, and refused to free his prisoners so they could return home?”’ (tn Heb “and his prisoners did not let loose to [their] homes.” This really means, “he did not let loose his prisoners and send them back to their homes.’ On the elliptical style, see GKC 366 §117. o.)"},{"number":18,"verse":"(sn It is unclear where the quotation of the kings, begun in v. 10b, ends. However, the reference to the “kings of the nations” in v. 18 (see also v. 9) seems to indicate that the quotation has ended at this point and that Israel’s direct taunt (cf. vv. 4b–10a) has resumed. In fact the references to the “kings of the nations” may form a stylistic inclusio or frame around the quotation.) As for all the kings of the nations, all of them (tc The phrase “all of them” does not appear in the Qumran scroll 1QIsaa.) lie down in splendor, (sn This refers to the typically extravagant burial of kings.) each in his own tomb.

Their yoke will be removed from my people, the burden will be lifted from their shoulders. (tn Heb “and his [i. e., Assyria’s] yoke will be removed from them [the people?], and his [Assyria’s] burden from his [the nation’s?] shoulder will be removed.” There are no antecedents in this oracle for the suffixes in the phrases “from them” and “from his shoulder.” Since the Lord’s land and hills are referred to in the preceding line and the statement seems to echo 10:27, it is likely that God’s people are the referents of the suffixes; the translation uses “my people” to indicate this.)"},{"number":26,"verse":"This is the plan I have devised for the whole earth; my hand is ready to strike all the nations.” (tn Heb “and this is the hand that is outstretched over all the nations.”)"},{"number":27,"verse":"Indeed, (tn Or “For” (KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV).) the LORD who commands armies has a plan, and who can possibly frustrate it?

For a viper will grow out of the serpent’s root, and its fruit will be a darting adder. (tn Heb “flying burning one.” The designation “burning one” may allude to the serpent’s appearance or the effect of its poisonous bite. (See the note at 6:2.) The qualifier “flying” probably refers to the serpent’s quick, darting movements, though one might propose a homonym here, meaning “biting.” (See J. N. Oswalt, Isaiah [NICOT], 1:332, n. 18.) Some might think in terms of a mythological flying, fire breathing dragon (cf.
