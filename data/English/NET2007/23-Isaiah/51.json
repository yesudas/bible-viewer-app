When I summoned him, he was a lone individual, (tn Heb “one”; NLT “was alone”; TEV “was childless.”) but I blessed him (tn “Bless” may here carry the sense of “endue with potency, reproductive power.” See Gen 1:28.) and gave him numerous descendants. (tn Heb “and I made him numerous.”)"},{"number":3,"verse":"Certainly the LORD will console Zion; he will console all her ruins. He will make her wilderness like Eden, her desert like the Garden of the LORD.

(tn Heb “and my arms will judge [on behalf of] nations.”) The coastlands (tn Or “islands” (NIV); TEV “Distant lands.”) wait patiently for me; they wait in anticipation for the revelation of my power.

For the sky will dissipate (tn Heb “will be torn in pieces.” The perfect indicates the certitude of the event, from the Lord’s rhetorical perspective.) like smoke, and the earth will wear out like clothes; its residents will die like gnats. But the deliverance I give (tn Heb “my deliverance.” The same Hebrew word can also be translated “salvation” (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT); cf.

Wake up! Clothe yourself with strength, O arm of the LORD! (tn The arm of the Lord is a symbol of divine military power. Here it is personified and told to arouse itself from sleep and prepare for action.) Wake up as in former times, as in antiquity! Did you not smash (tn Heb “Are you not the one who smashed?” The feminine singular forms agree grammatically with the feminine noun “arm.” The Hebrew text has ַהמַּחְצֶבֶת (hammakhtsevet), from the verbal root חָצַב (khatsav, “hew, chop”). The Qumran scroll 1QIsaa has, probably correctly, המחצת, from the verbal root מָחַץ (makhats, “smash”) which is used in Job 26:12 to describe God’s victory over “the Proud One.”) the Proud One? (tn This title (רַהַב, rahav, “proud one”) is sometimes translated as a proper name: “Rahab” (cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV). It is used here of a symbolic sea monster, known elsewhere in the Bible and in Ugaritic myth as Leviathan. This sea creature symbolizes the forces of chaos that seek to destroy the created order. In the Bible “the Proud One” opposes God’s creative work, but is defeated (see Job 26:12; Ps 89:10). Here the title refers to Pharaoh’s Egyptian army that opposed Israel at the Red Sea (see v. 10, and note also Isa 30:7 and Ps 87:4, where the title is used of Egypt).) Did you not (tn The words “did you not” are understood by ellipsis (note the preceding line). The rhetorical questions here and in v. 10 expect the answer, “Yes, you certainly did!”) wound the sea monster? (tn Hebrew תַּנִּין (tannin) is another name for the symbolic sea monster. See the note at 27:1. In this context the sea creature represents Egypt. See the note on the title “Proud One” earlier in this verse.)"},{"number":10,"verse":"Did you not dry up the sea, the waters of the great deep? Did you not make (tn The Hebrew text reads literally, “Are you not the one who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made…?”) a path through the depths of the sea, so those delivered from bondage (tn Heb “the redeemed” (so ASV, NASB, NIV, NRSV); KJV “the ransomed.”) could cross over?"},{"number":11,"verse":"Those whom the LORD has ransomed will return; they will enter Zion with a happy shout. Unending joy will crown them, (tn Heb “[will be] on their head[s].” “Joy” may be likened here to a crown (cf. 2 Sam 1:10). The statement may also be an ironic twist on the idiom “earth/dust on the head” (cf. 2 Sam 1:2; 13:19; 15:32; Job 2:12), referring to a mourning practice.) happiness and joy will overwhelm (tn Heb “overtake” (so NIV); NASB “they will obtain.”) them; grief and suffering will disappear.

(tc The plural suffix should probably be emended to the second masculine singular (which is used in v. 13). The final mem (ם) is probably dittographic; note the mem at the beginning of the next word.) Why are you afraid of mortal men, of mere human beings who are as short-lived as grass? (tn Heb “Who are you that you are afraid of man who dies, and of the son of man who [as] grass is given up?” The feminine singular forms should probably be emended to the masculine singular (see v. 13). They have probably been influenced by the construction אַתְּ־הִיא (’at-hi’) in vv. 9–10.)"},{"number":13,"verse":"Why do you forget (tn Heb “and that you forget.”) the LORD, who made you, who stretched out the sky (tn Or “the heavens” (also in v. 16).

Why do you constantly tremble all day long (tn Heb “and that you tremble constantly all the day.”) at the anger of the oppressor, when he makes plans to destroy? Where is the anger of the oppressor?

The LORD who commands armies is his name!"},{"number":16,"verse":"Zion’s Time to Celebrate I commission you (tn The addressee (second masculine singular, as in vv. 13, 15) in this verse is unclear. The exiles are addressed in the immediately preceding verses (note the critical tone of vv. 12–13 and the reference to the exiles in v. 14). However, it seems unlikely that they are addressed in v. 16, for the addressee appears to be commissioned to tell Zion, who here represents the restored exiles, “you are my people.” The addressee is distinct from the exiles. The language of v. 16a is reminiscent of 49:2 and 50:4, where the Lord’s special servant says he is God’s spokesman and effective instrument. Perhaps the Lord, having spoken to the exiles in vv. 1–15, now responds to this servant, who spoke just prior to this in 50:4–11.) as my spokesman; (tn Heb “I place my words in your mouth.”) I cover you with the palm of my hand, (tn Heb “with the shadow of my hand.”) to establish (tc The Hebrew text has לִנְטֹעַ (lintoa’, “to plant”).

However, since the Qumran scroll 1QIsaa, LXX (and Aquila and Symmachus), and Vulgate support the MT reading, there is no need to emend the form. The interpretation is clear enough: Yahweh fixed the sky in its place.) the sky and to found the earth, to say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’” (tn The infinitives in v. 16b are most naturally understood as indicating the purpose of the divine actions described in v. 16a. The relationship of the third infinitive to the commission is clear enough – the Lord has made the addressee (his special servant?) his spokesman so that the latter might speak encouraging words to those in Zion. But how do the first two infinitives relate? The text seems to indicate that the Lord has commissioned the addressee so that the latter might create the universe! Perhaps creation imagery is employed metaphorically here to refer to the transformation that Jerusalem will experience (see 65:17–18).)"},{"number":17,"verse":"Wake up! Wake up! Get up, O Jerusalem!
