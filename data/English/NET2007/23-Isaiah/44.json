I will pour my spirit on your offspring and my blessing on your children."},{"number":4,"verse":"They will sprout up like a tree in the grass, (tn The Hebrew term בֵין (ven) is usually taken as a preposition, in which case one might translate, “among the grass.” But בֵין is probably the name of a tree (cf. C. R. North, Second Isaiah, 133). If one alters the preposition bet (בְּ) to kaf (כְּ), one can then read, “like a binu-tree.” (The Qumran scroll 1QIsaa supports this reading.) This forms a nice parallel to “like poplars” in the next line. חָצִיר (khatsir) is functioning as an adverbial accusative of location.) like poplars beside channels of water."},{"number":5,"verse":"One will say, ‘I belong to the LORD,’ and another will use (tn The Hebrew text has a Qal verb form, “and another will call by the name of Jacob.” With support from Symmachus (an ancient Greek textual witness), some read the Niphal, “and another will be called by the name of Jacob.”) the name ‘Jacob.’ One will write on his hand, ‘The LORD’s,’ and use the name ‘Israel.’” (tn Heb “and by the name of Israel he will title.” Some, with support from several ancient versions, prefer to change the Piel (active) verb form to a Pual (passive), “and he will be titled by the name of Israel.”)"},{"number":6,"verse":"(The Absurdity of Idolatry) This is what the LORD, Israel’s king, says, their protector, (tn Heb “his kinsman redeemer.” See the note at 41:14.) the LORD who commands armies: “I am the first and I am the last, there is no God but me."},{"number":7,"verse":"Who is like me? Let him make his claim!

One of the options assumes the reading מַשְׁמִיעִים מֵעוֹלָם אוֹתִיּוֹת (mashmi’im me’olam ’otiyyot); This literally reads “the ones causing to hear from antiquity coming things,” but more idiomatically would read “as for those who predict from antiquity what will happen” (cf. NAB, NEB, REB). The emendation directs the attention of the reader to those who claim to be able to predict the future, challenging them to actually do what they claim they can do. The MT presents Yahweh as an example to whom these alleged “predictors of the future” can compare themselves. Since the ancient versions are unanimous in their support of the MT, the emendations should be set aside.) let them announce future events!

(tn BDB 923 s. v. רָהָה derives this verb from an otherwise unattested root, while HALOT 403 s. v. יָרָה defines it as “be stupefied” on the basis of an Arabic cognate.

I formed you to be my servant; O Israel, I will not forget you! (tc The verb in the Hebrew text is a Niphal imperfect with a pronominal suffix. Although the Niphal ordinarily has the passive sense, it can have a reflexive nuance as well (see above translation). Some have suggested an emendation to a Qal form: “Do not forget me” (all the ancient versions, NEB, REB; see GKC 369 §117. x). “Do not forget me” would make a good parallel with “remember these things” in the first line. Since the MT is the harder reading and fits with Israel’s complaint that God had forgotten her (Isa 40:27), the MT reading should be retained (NASB, NKJV, NRSV, ESV). The passive has been rendered as an active in the translation in keeping with contemporary English style (so also NIV, NCV, TEV, NLT).)"},{"number":22,"verse":"I remove the guilt of your rebellious deeds as if they were a cloud, the guilt of your sins as if they were a cloud. (tn Heb “I blot out like a cloud your rebellious deeds, and like a cloud your sins.” “Rebellious deeds” and “sins” stand by metonymy for the guilt they produce. Both עָב (’av) and עָנָן (’anan) refer to the clouds in the sky. It is tempting for stylistic purposes to translate the second with “fog” or “mist” (cf. NAB, NRSV “cloud…mist”; NIV “cloud…morning mist”; NLT “morning mists…clouds”), but this distinction between the synonyms is unwarranted here. The point of the simile seems to be this: The Lord forgives their sins, causing them to vanish just as clouds disappear from the sky (see Job 7:9; 30:15).)

In the four other occurrences of this word (Job 11:3; Isa 16:6; Jer 48:30; 50:36) the context does not make the meaning of the term very clear. Its primary point appears to be that the words spoken are meaningless or false. In light of its parallelism with “omen readers,” some have proposed an emendation to בָּרִים (barim, “seers”). The Mesopotamian baru-priests were divination specialists who played an important role in court life. See R. Wilson, Prophecy and Society in Ancient Israel, 93-98. Rather than supporting an emendation, J. N. Oswalt (Isaiah [NICOT], 2:189, n. 79) suggests that Isaiah used בַּדִּים purposively as a derisive wordplay on the Akkadian word baru (in light of the close similarity of the d and r consonants).) and humiliates (tn Or “makes fools of” (NIV, NRSV); NAB and NASB both similar.) the omen readers, who overturns the counsel of the wise men (tn Heb “who turns back the wise” (so NRSV); NIV “overthrows the learning of the wise”; TEV “The words of the wise I refute.”) and makes their advice (tn Heb “their knowledge” (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NRSV).) seem foolish,"},{"number":26,"verse":"who fulfills the oracles of his prophetic servants (tn Heb “the word of his servant.” The following context indicates that the Lord’s prophets are in view.) and brings to pass the announcements (tn Heb “counsel.” The Hebrew term עֵצָה (’etsah) probably refers here to the divine plan as announced by the prophets.
