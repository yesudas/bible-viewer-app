The splendor (tn Or “glory” (so most English versions).) of the LORD shines on you!"},{"number":2,"verse":"For, look, darkness covers the earth and deep darkness covers (tn The verb “covers” is understood by ellipsis (note the preceding line).) the nations, but the LORD shines on you; his splendor (tn Or “glory” (so most English versions); TEV “the brightness of his presence.”) appears over you."},{"number":3,"verse":"Nations come to your light, kings to your bright light."},{"number":4,"verse":"Look all around you! (tn Heb “Lift up around your eyes and see!”) They all gather and come to you — your sons come from far away and your daughters are escorted by guardians."},{"number":5,"verse":"Then you will look and smile, (tn Or “shine,” or “be radiant” (NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV).) you will be excited and your heart will swell with pride. (tn Heb “and it will tremble and be wide, your heart.”) For the riches of distant lands (tn Heb “the wealth of the sea,” i. e., wealth that is transported from distant lands via the sea.) will belong to you and the wealth of nations will come to you."},{"number":6,"verse":"Camel caravans will cover your roads, (tn Heb “an abundance of camels will cover you.”) young camels from Midian and Ephah. All the merchants of Sheba (tn Heb “all of them, from Sheba.”) will come, bringing gold and incense and singing praises to the LORD. (tn Heb “and they will announce the praises of the Lord.”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"All the sheep of Kedar will be gathered to you; the rams of Nebaioth will be available to you as sacrifices. (tn Heb “will serve you,” i. e., be available as sacrifices (see the next line). Another option is to understood these “rams” as symbolic of leaders who will be subject to the people of Zion. See v. 10.) They will go up on my altar acceptably, (tc Heb “they will go up on acceptance [on] my altar.” Some have suggested that the preposition עַל (’al) is dittographic (note the preceding יַעֲלוּ [ya’alu]). Consequently, the form should be emended to לְרָצוֹן (lÿratson, “acceptably”; see BDB 953 s. v. רָצוֹן). However, the Qumran scroll 1QIsaa has both לרצון followed by the preposition על, which would argue against deleted the preposition. As the above translation seeks to demonstrate, the preposition עַל (’al) indicates a norm (“in accordance with acceptance” or “acceptably”; IBHS 218 §11.2.13e, n. 111) and the “altar” functions as an objective accusative with a verb of motion (cf. Gen 49:4; Lev 2:2; Num 13:17; J. N. Oswalt, Isaiah [NICOT], 2:534, n. 14).) and I will bestow honor on my majestic temple."},{"number":8,"verse":"Who are these who float along (tn Heb “fly” (so KJV, NASB, NRSV); NAB, NIV “fly along.”) like a cloud, who fly like doves to their shelters? (tn Heb “to their windows,” i. e., to the openings in their coops. See HALOT 83 s. v. אֲרֻבָּה.)"},{"number":9,"verse":"Indeed, the coastlands (tn Or “islands” (NIV); CEV “distant islands”; TEV “distant lands.”) look eagerly for me, the large ships (tn Heb “the ships of Tarshish.” See the note at 2:16.) are in the lead, bringing your sons from far away, along with their silver and gold, to honor the LORD your God, (tn Heb “to the name of the Lord your God.”) the Holy One of Israel, (sn See the note on the phrase “the Holy One of Israel” in 1:4.) for he has bestowed honor on you."},{"number":10,"verse":"Foreigners will rebuild your walls; their kings will serve you. Even though I struck you down in my anger, I will restore my favor and have compassion on you. (tn Heb “in my favor I will have compassion on you.”)"},{"number":11,"verse":"Your gates will remain open at all times; they will not be shut during the day or at night, so that the wealth of nations may be delivered, with their kings leading the way. (tn Or “led in procession.” The participle is passive.)"},{"number":12,"verse":"Indeed, (tn Or “For” (KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT); TEV “But.”) nations or kingdoms that do not serve you will perish; such nations will be totally destroyed. (tn The infinitive absolute appears before the finite verb for emphasis.)"},{"number":13,"verse":"The splendor of Lebanon will come to you, its evergreens, firs, and cypresses together, to beautify my palace; (tn Or “holy place, sanctuary.”) I will bestow honor on my throne room. (tn Heb “the place of my feet.” See Ezek 43:7, where the Lord’s throne is called the “place of the soles of my feet.”)"},{"number":14,"verse":"The children of your oppressors will come bowing to you; all who treated you with disrespect will bow down at your feet.

(sn The nations and kings are depicted as a mother nursing her children. Restored Zion will be nourished by them as she receives their wealth as tribute.)

(sn See 1:24 and 49:26.)"},{"number":17,"verse":"Instead of bronze, I will bring you gold, instead of iron, I will bring you silver, instead of wood, I will bring you (tn The words “I will bring you” are supplied in the translation; they are understood by ellipsis (see the preceding lines).) bronze, instead of stones, I will bring you (tn The words “I will bring you” are supplied in the translation; they are understood by ellipsis (see the first two lines of the verse).) iron. I will make prosperity (tn Or “peace” (KJV and many other English versions).) your overseer, and vindication your sovereign ruler. (tn The plural indicates degree. The language is ironic; in the past Zion was ruled by oppressive tyrants, but now personified prosperity and vindication will be the only things that will “dominate” the city.)"},{"number":18,"verse":"Sounds of violence (tn The words “sounds of” are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.) will no longer be heard in your land, or the sounds of (tn The words “sounds of” are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.) destruction and devastation within your borders.
