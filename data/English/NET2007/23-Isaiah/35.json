The ambiguous verbal form is translated as a jussive because it is parallel to the jussive form תָגֵל (tagel). The jussive is used rhetorically here, not as a literal command or prayer.) let the wilderness (tn Or “Arabah” (NASB); NAB, NIV, TEV “desert.”) rejoice and bloom like a lily!"},{"number":2,"verse":"Let it richly bloom; (tn The ambiguous verb form תִּפְרַח (tifrakh) is translated as a jussive because it is parallel to the jussive form תָגֵל (tagel).) let it rejoice and shout with delight!
