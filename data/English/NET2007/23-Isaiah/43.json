(tn The Hebrew text reads literally, “as for the Babylonians, in ships their joyful shout.” This might be paraphrased, “even the Babylonians in the ships [over which] they joyfully shouted.” The point would be that the Lord caused the Babylonians to flee for safety in the ships in which they took such great pride. A slight change in vocalization yields the reading “into mourning songs,” which provides a good contrast with “joyful shout.” The prefixed bet (בְּ) would indicate identity.)"},{"number":15,"verse":"I am the LORD, your Holy One, (sn See the note on the phrase “the Holy One of Israel” in 1:4.) the one who created Israel, your king.”"},{"number":16,"verse":"This is what the LORD says, the one who made a road through the sea, a pathway through the surging waters,"},{"number":17,"verse":"the one who led chariots and horses to destruction, (tn Heb “led out chariots and horses.” The words “to destruction” are supplied in the translation for clarification.

Yet you burdened me with your sins; you made me weary with your evil deeds. (sn In vv. 22–24 the Lord appears to be condemning his people for failure to bring the proper sacrifices. However, this is problematic. If this refers to the nation’s behavior while in exile, such cultic service was impossible and could hardly be expected by the Lord. If this refers to the nation’s conduct before the exile, it contradicts other passages that depict Israel as bringing excessive sacrifices (see, e. g., Isa 1:11–14; Jer 6:20; Amos 4:4–5, 5:21–23). Rather than being a condemnation of Israel’s failure to bring sacrifices, these verses are better taken as a highly rhetorical comment on the worthlessness of Israel’s religious ritual. They may have brought sacrifices, but not to the Lord, for he did not accept them or even want them. See C. R. North, Second Isaiah, 127, and R. Whybray, Isaiah 40–66 (NCBC), 91.)"},{"number":25,"verse":"I, I am the one who blots out your rebellious deeds for my sake; your sins I do not remember."},{"number":26,"verse":"Remind me of what happened!
