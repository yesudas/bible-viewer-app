This is wood from the acacia, the most common timber tree of the Sinai region. Most likely it is the species Acacia raddiana because this has the largest trunk. See F. N.

This was not the initial commissioning of the tribe of Levi to this ministry (cf. Num 3:11–13; 8:12–26), but with Aaron’s death it seemed appropriate to Moses to reiterate Levi’s responsibilities.

As the priestly tribe, Levi would have no land allotment except for forty-eight towns set apart for their use (Num 35:1–8; Josh 21:1–42).
