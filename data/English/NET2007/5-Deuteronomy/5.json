He said:"},{"number":6,"verse":"(The Ten Commandments) “I am the LORD your God, he who brought you from the land of Egypt, from the place of slavery."},{"number":7,"verse":"You must not have any other gods (tn Heb “there must not be for you other gods.” The expression “for you” indicates possession.) besides me. (tn Heb “upon my face,” or “before me” (עַל־פָּנָיַ, ’al-panaya). Some understand this in a locative sense: “in my sight.” The translation assumes that the phrase indicates exclusion. The idea is that of placing any other god before the Lord in the sense of taking his place. Contrary to the view of some, this does not leave the door open for a henotheistic system where the Lord is the primary god among others. In its literary context the statement must be taken in a monotheistic sense. See, e. g., 4:39; 6:13–15.)"},{"number":8,"verse":"You must not make for yourself an image (tn Heb “an image, any likeness.”) of anything in heaven above, on earth below, or in the waters beneath. (tn Heb “under the earth” (so ASV, NASB, NRSV); NCV “below the land.”)"},{"number":9,"verse":"You must not worship or serve them, for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God. I punish (tn In the Hebrew text the form is a participle, which is subordinated to what precedes. For the sake of English style, the translation divides this lengthy verse into two sentences.) the sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons for the sin of the fathers who reject (tn Heb “who hate” (so NAB, NIV, NLT). Just as “to love” (אָהַב, ’ahav) means in a covenant context “to choose, obey,” so “to hate” (שָׂנֵא, sane’) means “to reject, disobey” (cf. the note on the word “loved” in Deut 4:37; see also 5:10).) me, (tn Heb “visiting the sin of fathers upon sons and upon a third (generation) and upon a fourth (generation) of those who hate me.” God sometimes punishes children for the sins of a father (cf. Num 16:27, 32; Josh 7:24–25; 2 Sam 21:1–9). On the principle of corporate solidarity and responsibility in OT thought see J. Kaminsky, Corporate Responsibility in the Hebrew Bible (JSOTSup). In the idiom of the text, the father is the first generation and the “sons” the second generation, making grandsons the third and great-grandsons the fourth. The reference to a third and fourth generation is a way of emphasizing that the sinner’s punishment would last throughout his lifetime. In this culture, where men married and fathered children at a relatively young age, it would not be unusual for one to see his great-grandsons. In an Aramaic tomb inscription from Nerab dating to the seventh century b. c., Agbar observes that he was surrounded by “children of the fourth generation” as he lay on his death bed (see ANET 661). The language of the text differs from Exod 34:7, the sons are the first generation, the grandsons (literally, “sons of the sons”) the second, great-grandsons the third, and great-great-grandsons the fourth. One could argue that formulation in Deut 5:9 (see also Exod 20:50) is elliptical/abbreviated or that it suffers from textual corruption (the repetition of the words “sons” would invite accidental omission).)"},{"number":10,"verse":"but I show covenant faithfulness (tn This theologically rich term (חֶסֶד, khesed) describes God’s loyalty to those who keep covenant with him.

Zobel, TDOT 5:44-64.) to the thousands (tc By a slight emendation (לַאֲלּוּפִים [la’allufim] for לַאֲלָפִים [la’alafim]) “clans” could be read in place of the MT reading “thousands.” However, no ms or versional evidence exists to support this emendation. tn Another option is to understand this as referring to “thousands (of generations) of those who love me” (cf. NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT).

In ancient Israel this would include using the Lord’s name as a witness in vows one did not intend to keep.) for the LORD will not exonerate anyone who abuses his name that way.

The verb here (רָצַח, ratsakh) is generic for homicide but in the OT both killing in war and capital punishment were permitted and even commanded (Deut 13:5, 9; 20:13, 16–17), so the technical meaning here is “murder.”)"},{"number":18,"verse":"You must not commit adultery."},{"number":19,"verse":"You must not steal."},{"number":20,"verse":"You must not offer false testimony against another.
