NAB) describes persons, things, or practices offensive to ritual or moral order. See M. Grisanti, NIDOTTE 4:314-18; see also the note on the word “abhorrent” in Deut 7:25.) to the LORD your God."},{"number":2,"verse":"Suppose a man or woman is discovered among you — in one of your villages (tn Heb “gates.”) that the LORD your God is giving you — who sins before the Lord your God (tn Heb “does the evil in the eyes of the Lord your God.”) and breaks his covenant"},{"number":3,"verse":"by serving other gods and worshiping them — the sun, (tc The MT reads “and to the sun,” thus including the sun, the moon, and other heavenly spheres among the gods. However, Theodotion and Lucian read “or to the sun,” suggesting perhaps that the sun and the other heavenly bodies are not in the category of actual deities.) moon, or any other heavenly bodies which I have not permitted you to worship. (tn Heb “which I have not commanded you.” The words “to worship” are supplied in the translation for clarification.)"},{"number":4,"verse":"When it is reported to you and you hear about it, you must investigate carefully. If it is indeed true that such a disgraceful thing (tn Heb “an abomination” (תּוֹעֵבָה); see note on the word “offensive” in v. 1.) is being done in Israel,"},{"number":5,"verse":"you must bring to your city gates (tn Heb “gates.”) that man or woman who has done this wicked thing — that very man or woman — and you must stone that person to death. (tn Heb “stone them with stones so that they die” (KJV similar); NCV “throw stones at that person until he dies.”)"},{"number":6,"verse":"At the testimony of two or three witnesses they must be executed. They cannot be put to death on the testimony of only one witness."},{"number":7,"verse":"The witnesses (tn Heb “the hand of the witnesses.” This means the two or three witnesses are to throw the first stones (cf. NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT).) must be first to begin the execution, and then all the people (tn Heb “the hand of all the people.”) are to join in afterward. In this way you will purge evil from among you."},{"number":8,"verse":"(Appeal to a Higher Court) If a matter is too difficult for you to judge — bloodshed, (tn Heb “between blood and blood.”) legal claim, (tn Heb “between claim and claim.”) or assault (tn Heb “between blow and blow.”) — matters of controversy in your villages (tn Heb “gates.”) — you must leave there and go up to the place the LORD your God chooses. (tc Several Greek recensions add “to place his name there,” thus completing the usual formula to describe the central sanctuary (cf. Deut 12:5, 11, 14, 18; 16:6). However, the context suggests that the local Levitical towns, and not the central sanctuary, are in mind.)"},{"number":9,"verse":"You will go to the Levitical priests and the judge in office in those days and seek a solution; they will render a verdict."},{"number":10,"verse":"You must then do as they have determined at that place the LORD chooses. Be careful to do just as you are taught."},{"number":11,"verse":"You must do what you are instructed, and the verdict they pronounce to you, without fail.

The same phrase also occurs in v. 20.) you must appoint a king — you may not designate a foreigner who is not one of your fellow Israelites.

From this Greek phrase the present name of the book, “Deuteronomy” or “second law” (i. e., the second giving of the law), is derived. However, the MT’s expression מִשְׁנֶה הַתּוֹרָה הַזֹּאת (mishneh hattorah hazzo’t) is better rendered “copy of this law.” Here the term תּוֹרָה (torah) probably refers only to the book of Deuteronomy and not to the whole Pentateuch.) on a scroll (tn The Hebrew term סֵפֶר (sefer) means a “writing” or “document” and could be translated “book” (so KJV, ASV, TEV).
