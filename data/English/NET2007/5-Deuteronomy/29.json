With 30:1 the verse numbers in the ET and HT are again the same.) These are the words of the covenant that the LORD commanded Moses to make with the people of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb. (sn Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai (which some English versions substitute here for clarity, cf. NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT).)"},{"number":2,"verse":"(The Exodus, Wandering, and Conquest Reviewed) Moses proclaimed to all Israel as follows: “You have seen all that the LORD did (tn The Hebrew text includes “to your eyes,” but this is redundant in English style (cf. the preceding “you have seen”) and is omitted in the translation.) in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, all his servants, and his land."},{"number":3,"verse":"Your eyes have seen the great judgments, (tn Heb “testings.” This is a reference to the plagues; see note at 4:34.) those signs and mighty wonders."},{"number":4,"verse":"But to this very day the LORD has not given you an understanding mind, perceptive eyes, or discerning ears!

Its comparative difficulty favors the originality of the MT reading. Cf.

(tn Heb “the watered with the parched.” The word “ground” is implied. The exact meaning of the phrase is uncertain although it appears to be figurative. This appears to be a proverbial observation employing a figure of speech (a merism) suggesting totality.
