You must do this so you will remember for the rest of your life the day you came out of the land of Egypt."},{"number":4,"verse":"There must not be a scrap of yeast within your land (tn Heb “leaven must not be seen among you in all your border.”) for seven days, nor can any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until the next morning. (tn Heb “remain all night until the morning” (so KJV, ASV). This has been simplified in the translation for stylistic reasons.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"You may not sacrifice the Passover in just any of your villages (tn Heb “gates.”) that the LORD your God is giving you,"},{"number":6,"verse":"but you must sacrifice it (tn Heb “the Passover.” The translation uses a pronoun to avoid redundancy in English.) in the evening in (tc The MT reading אֶל (’el, “unto”) before “the place” should, following Smr, Syriac, Targums, and Vulgate, be omitted in favor of ב (bet; בַּמָּקוֹם, bammaqom), “in the place.”) the place where he (tn Heb “the Lord your God.” See note on “he” in 16:1.) chooses to locate his name, at sunset, the time of day you came out of Egypt."},{"number":7,"verse":"You must cook (tn The rules that governed the Passover meal are found in Exod 12:1–51, and Deut 16:1–8. The word translated “cook” (בָּשַׁל, bashal) here is translated “boil” in other places (e. g. Exod 23:19, 1 Sam 2:13–15). This would seem to contradict Exod 12:9 where the Israelites are told not to eat the Passover sacrifice raw or boiled. However, 2 Chr 35:13 recounts the celebration of a Passover feast during the reign of Josiah, and explains that the people “cooked (בָּשַׁל, bashal) the Passover sacrifices over the open fire.” The use of בָּשַׁל (bashal) with “fire” (אֵשׁ, ’esh) suggests that the word could be used to speak of boiling or roasting.) and eat it in the place the LORD your God chooses; you may return the next morning to your tents."},{"number":8,"verse":"You must eat bread made without yeast for six days.

The rendering “booths” (cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV) is now preferable to the traditional “tabernacles” (KJV, ASV, NIV) in light of the meaning of the term סֻכָּה (sukkah, “hut; booth”), but “booths” are frequently associated with trade shows and craft fairs in contemporary American English. Clearer is the English term “shelters” (so NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT), but this does not reflect the temporary nature of the living arrangement. This feast was a commemoration of the wanderings of the Israelites after they left Egypt, suggesting that a translation like “temporary shelters” is more appropriate.) for seven days, at the time of the grain and grape harvest.
