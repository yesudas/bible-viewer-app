But contrary to expectations, the Jews gained power over their enemies."},{"number":2,"verse":"The Jews assembled themselves in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike out against those who were seeking their harm. No one was able to stand before them, for dread of them fell on all the peoples."},{"number":3,"verse":"All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who performed the king’s business were assisting the Jews, for the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them."},{"number":4,"verse":"Mordecai was of high rank (tn Heb “great”; NRSV “powerful”; NIV “prominent”; NCV “very important.”) in the king’s palace, and word about him was spreading throughout all the provinces.

A law was passed in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged."},{"number":15,"verse":"The Jews who were in Susa then assembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they killed three hundred men in Susa. But they did not confiscate their property."},{"number":16,"verse":"The rest of the Jews who were throughout the provinces of the king assembled in order to stand up for themselves and to have rest from their enemies.
