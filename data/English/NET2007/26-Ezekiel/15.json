(tn Most modern translations take the statement as a comparison (“how is vine wood better than any forest wood?”) based on the preposition מִן (min). But a comparison should have a word as an adjective or stative verb designating a quality, i. e., a word for “good/better” is lacking. The preposition is translated above in its partitive sense. sn Comparing Israel to the wood of the vine may focus on Israel’s inferiority to the other nations. For the vine imagery in relation to Israel and the people of God, see Ps 80:8–13; John 15:1–7; Rom 11:17–22.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful?
