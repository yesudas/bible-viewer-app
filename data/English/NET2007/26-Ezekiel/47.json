I. Block, Ezekiel (NICOT), 2:715.) you will observe as you allot the land to the twelve tribes of Israel. (Joseph will have two portions.) (tc The grammar is awkward, though the presence of these words is supported by the versions. L. C. Allen (Ezekiel [WBC], 2:274) suggests that it is an explanatory gloss. sn One portion for Ephraim, the other for Manasseh (Gen 48:17–20).)"},{"number":14,"verse":"You must divide it equally just as I vowed to give it to your forefathers; (sn Gen 15:9–21.) this land will be assigned as your inheritance.
