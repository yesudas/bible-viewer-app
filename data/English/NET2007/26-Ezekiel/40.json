Therefore the measuring stick in the man’s hand was 10.5 feet (3.15 meters) long. Because modern readers are not familiar with the cubit as a unit of measurement, and due to the additional complication of the “long” cubit as opposed to the regular cubit, all measurements have been converted to American standard feet and inches, with the Hebrew measurements and the metric equivalents given in the notes.) long. He measured the thickness of the wall (tn Heb “building.”) as 10Â½ feet, (tn Heb “one rod [or “reed”]” (also a second time in this verse, twice in v. 6, three times in v. 7, and once in v. 8).) and its height as 10Â½ feet."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then he went to the gate facing east. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate as 10Â½ feet deep. (tn The Hebrew text adds “the one threshold 10½ feet deep.” This is probably an accidental duplication of what precedes.
