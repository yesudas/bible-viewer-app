The king of Babylon has laid siege (tn Heb “lean on, put pressure on.”) to Jerusalem (map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) this very day."},{"number":3,"verse":"Recite a proverb to this rebellious house (sn The book of Ezekiel frequently refers to the Israelites as a rebellious house (Ezek 2:5, 6, 8; 3:9, 26–27; 12:2–3, 9, 25; 17:12; 24:3).) and say to them, ‘This is what the sovereign LORD says: “‘Set on the pot, (sn See Ezek 11:3–12.) set it on, pour water in it too;"},{"number":4,"verse":"add the pieces of meat to it, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with choice bones."},{"number":5,"verse":"Take the choice bone of the flock, heap up bones under it; boil rapidly, and boil its bones in it."},{"number":6,"verse":"“‘Therefore this is what the sovereign LORD says: Woe to the city of bloodshed, the pot whose rot (tn Or “rust.”) is in it, whose rot has not been removed (tn Heb “has not gone out.”) from it! Empty it piece by piece. No lot has fallen on it. (tn Here “lot” may refer to the decision made by casting lots; it is not chosen at all.)"},{"number":7,"verse":"For her blood was in it; she poured it on an exposed rock; she did not pour it on the ground to cover it up with dust."},{"number":8,"verse":"To arouse anger, to take vengeance, I have placed her blood on an exposed rock so that it cannot be covered up."},{"number":9,"verse":"“‘Therefore this is what the sovereign LORD says: Woe to the city of bloodshed!

The first word in the statement (rendered “toil” in the literal translation above) occurs only here in the OT, and the verb “she has wearied” lacks a stated object. Elsewhere the Hiphil of the verb refers to wearying someone or trying someone’s patience. The feminine subject is apparently the symbolic pot.) yet its thick rot is not removed (tn Heb “does not go out.”) from it. Subject its rot to the fire! (tn Heb “in fire its rust.” The meaning of the expression is unclear. The translation understands the statement as a command to burn the rust away. See D. I. Block, Ezekiel (NICOT), 1:768.)"},{"number":13,"verse":"You mix uncleanness with obscene conduct. (tn Heb “in your uncleanness (is) obscene conduct.”) I tried to cleanse you, (tn Heb “because I cleansed you.” In this context (see especially the very next statement), the statement must refer to divine intention and purpose. Despite God’s efforts to cleanse his people, they resisted him and remained morally impure.) but you are not clean. You will not be cleansed from your uncleanness (tn The Hebrew text adds the word “again.”) until I have exhausted my anger on you."},{"number":14,"verse":"“‘I the LORD have spoken; judgment (tn Heb “it”; the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity.) is coming and I will act! I will not relent, or show pity, or be sorry! (tn Or perhaps, “change my mind.”) I will judge you (tc Some medieval Hebrew mss and the major ancient versions read a first person verb here. Most Hebrew mss read have an indefinite subject, “they will judge you,” which could be translated, “you will be judged.”) according to your conduct (tn Heb “ways.”) and your deeds, declares the sovereign LORD.’”"},{"number":15,"verse":"(Ezekiel’s Wife Dies) The word of LORD came to me:"},{"number":16,"verse":"“Son of man, realize that I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you with a jolt, (tn Heb “a strike.”) but you must not mourn or weep or shed tears."},{"number":17,"verse":"Groan in silence for the dead, (tn Or “Groan silently. As to the dead….” Cf. M. Greenberg’s suggestion that דֹּם מֵתִים (dom metim) be taken together and דֹּם be derived from ָדּמַם (damam, “to moan, murmur”). See M. Greenberg, Ezekiel (AB), 2:508.) but do not perform mourning rites. (tn Heb “(For) the dead mourning you shall not conduct.” In the Hebrew text the word translated “dead” is plural, indicating that mourning rites are in view. Such rites would involve outward demonstrations of one’s sorrow, including wailing and weeping.) Bind on your turban (sn The turban would normally be removed for mourning (Josh 7:6; 1 Sam 4:12).) and put your sandals on your feet. Do not cover your lip (sn Mourning rites included covering the lower part of the face. See Lev 13:45.) and do not eat food brought by others.” (tn Heb “the bread of men.” The translation follows the suggestion accepted by M. Greenberg (Ezekiel [AB], 2:509) that this refers to a meal brought by comforters to the one mourning. Some repoint the consonantal text to read “the bread of despair” (see L. C. Allen, Ezekiel [WBC], 2:56), while others, with support from the Targum and Vulgate, emend the consonantal text to read “the bread of mourners” (see D. I. Block, Ezekiel [NICOT], 1:784).)"},{"number":18,"verse":"So I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening. In the morning (tn This may refer to the following morning. For a discussion of various interpretive options in understanding the chronology reflected in verse 18, see D. I. Block, Ezekiel (NICOT), 1:790.)

(tn Heb “the object of compassion of your soul.” The accentuation in the traditional Hebrew text indicates that the descriptive phrases (“the source of your confident pride, the object in which your eyes delight, and your life’s passion”) modify the preceding “my sanctuary.”) Your very own sons and daughters whom you have left behind will die (tn Heb “fall.”) by the sword."},{"number":22,"verse":"Then you will do as I have done: You will not cover your lip or eat food brought by others.

It seems more likely that the term has its well-attested nuance of “burden, load,” here and refers to that which weighs them down emotionally and is a constant source of concern or worry.) as well as their sons and daughters: (tn In the Hebrew text there is no conjunction before “their sons and daughters.” For this reason one might assume that the preceding descriptive phrases refer to the sons and daughters, but verse 21 suggests otherwise. The descriptive phrases appear to refer to the “stronghold,” which parallels “my sanctuary” in verse 21. The children constitute a separate category.)"},{"number":26,"verse":"On that day a fugitive will come to you to report the news.
