Then the sword comes and takes one of their lives. He is swept away for his iniquity, (tn Or “in his punishment.” The phrase “in/for [a person’s] iniquity/punishment” occurs fourteen times in Ezekiel: here and in vv. 8 and 9; 3:18, 19; 4:17; 7:13, 16; 18: 17, 18, 19, 20; 24:23; 39:23.

As for the wicked, his wickedness will not make him stumble if he turns from it.
