(tc The LXX, Syriac, Vulgate, and Targum mss read plural “cherubim” while the MT is singular here, “cherub.” The plural ending was probably omitted in copying the MT due to the similar beginning of the next word.) Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” He went as I watched."},{"number":3,"verse":"(The cherubim were standing on the south side (tn Heb “right side.”) of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.)"},{"number":4,"verse":"Then the glory of the LORD arose from the cherub and moved to the threshold of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud while the court was filled with the brightness of the LORD’s glory."},{"number":5,"verse":"The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard from the outer court, like the sound of the sovereign God (tn The name (“El Shaddai”) has often been translated “God Almighty,” primarily because Jerome translated it omnipotens (“all powerful”) in the Latin Vulgate.

Note that some English versions harmonize the two descriptions and read the same here as in 1:10 (cf. NAB, NLT “an ox”; TEV, CEV “a bull”). This may be justified based on v. 22, which states the creatures’ appearance was the same.) the second that of a man, the third that of a lion, and the fourth that of an eagle."},{"number":15,"verse":"The cherubim rose up; these were the living beings (tn Heb “it was the living creature.”) I saw at the Kebar River."},{"number":16,"verse":"When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them; when the cherubim spread (tn Heb “lifted.”) their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not move from their side."},{"number":17,"verse":"When the cherubim (tn Heb “they”; the referent (the cherubim) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) stood still, the wheels (tn Heb “they”; the referent (the wheels) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) stood still, and when they rose up, the wheels (tn Heb “they”; the referent (the wheels) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) rose up with them, for the spirit (tn Or “wind.”) of the living beings (tn Heb “living creature.”) was in the wheels.
