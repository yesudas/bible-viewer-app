Addressed to the prophet, “judge” means to warn of or pronounce God’s impending judgment upon the city. See 20:4.) are you willing to pronounce judgment on the bloody city? (tn The phrase “bloody city” is used of Nineveh in Nah 3:1.) Then confront her with all her abominable deeds!"},{"number":3,"verse":"Then say, ‘This is what the sovereign LORD says: O city, who spills blood within herself (which brings on her doom), (tn Heb “her time”; this refers to the time of impending judgment (see the note on “doom” in v. 4).) and who makes herself idols (which results in impurity),"},{"number":4,"verse":"you are guilty because of the blood you shed and defiled by the idols you made. You have hastened the day of your doom; (tn Heb “you have brought near your days.” The expression “bring near your days” appears to be an adaptation of the idiom “days draw near,” which is used to indicate that an event, such as death, is imminent (see Gen 27:41; 47:29; Deut 31:14; 1 Kgs 2:1; Ezek 12:23). Here “your days” probably refers to the days of the personified city’s life, which was about to come to an end through God’s judgment.) the end of your years has come. (tn Heb “and you have come to your years.” This appears to mean that she has arrived at the time when her years (i. e., life) would end, though it may mean that her years of punishment will begin. Because “day” and “time” are so closely associated in the immediate context (see 21:25, 29) some prefer to emend the text and read “you have brought near your time.” See L. C. Allen, Ezekiel (WBC), 2:31, as well as the translator’s note on verse 3.)

See 18:6.) they commit obscene acts among you. (sn This statement introduces vv. 10–11 and refers in general terms to the sexual sins described there.

If the singular is retained, it must be taken as indefinite and representative of the entire group. The idiomatic expression “uncover the nakedness” refers here to sexual intercourse (cf. Lev 18:6). To uncover a father’s nakedness could include sexual relations with one’s own mother (Lev 18:7), but more likely it refers to having intercourse with another wife of one’s father, such as a stepmother (Lev 18:8; cf. Gen 35:22; 49:4).) they violate women during their menstrual period within you. (tn Heb “(one who is) unclean due to the impurity they humble within you.” The use of the verb “to humble” suggests that these men forced themselves upon women during menstruation. Having sexual relations with a woman during her period was forbidden by the Law (Lev 18:19; 20:18).)"},{"number":11,"verse":"One (tn Heb “a man.”) commits an abominable act with his neighbor’s wife; another obscenely defiles his daughter-in-law; another violates (tn The verb is the same one used in verse 10b and suggests forcible sexual violation of the woman.) his sister — his father’s daughter (sn Sexual relations with one’s half-sister may be primarily in view here.

In light of the following reference to showers, the reading of the LXX certainly fits the context well. For a defense of the emendation, see L. C. Allen, Ezekiel (WBC), 2:32. Yet the MT is not an unreasonable reading since uncleanness in the land also fits the context, and a poetic connection between rain and the land being uncleansed may be feasible since washing with water is elsewhere associated with cleansing (Num 8:7; 31:23; Ps 51:7).) or showers in the day of my anger.’ (tn Heb “in a day of anger.”)"},{"number":25,"verse":"Her princes (tn Heb “a conspiracy of her prophets is in her midst.” The LXX reads “whose princes” rather than “a conspiracy of prophets.” The prophets are mentioned later in the paragraph (v. 28).
