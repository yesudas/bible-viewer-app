It also refers to large creatures that inhabit the sea (Gen 1:21; Ps 148:7). In several passages it is associated with the sea or with the multiheaded sea monster Leviathan (Job 7:12; Ps 74:13; Isa 27:1; 51:9). Because of the Egyptian setting of this prophecy and the reference to the creature’s scales (v. 4), many understand a crocodile to be the referent here (e. g., NCV “a great crocodile”; TEV “you monster crocodile”; CEV “a giant crocodile”).) lying in the midst of its waterways, who has said, “My Nile is my own, I made it for myself.” (sn In Egyptian theology Pharaoh owned and controlled the Nile.

(tn Heb “you caused to stand for them all their hips.” An emendation which switches two letters but is supported by the LXX yields the reading “you caused all their hips to shake.” See L. C. Allen, Ezekiel (WBC), 2:103. In 2 Kgs 18:21 and Isa 36:6 trusting in the Pharaoh is compared to leaning on a staff. The oracle may reflect Hophra’s attempt to aid Jerusalem (Jer 37:5–8).)"},{"number":8,"verse":"“‘Therefore, this is what the sovereign LORD says: Look, I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will kill (tn Heb “I will cut off from you.”) every person and every animal."},{"number":9,"verse":"The land of Egypt will become a desolate ruin.
