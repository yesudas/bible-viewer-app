In Ezekiel God’s hand being on the prophet is regularly associated with communication or a vision from God (3:14, 22; 8:1; 37:1; 40:1).) of the LORD was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and placed (tn Heb “caused me to rest.”) me in the midst of the valley, and it was full of bones."},{"number":2,"verse":"He made me walk all around among them. (tn Heb “and he made me pass over them, around, around.”) I realized (tn The word הִנֵּה (hinneh, traditionally “behold”) indicates becoming aware of something and is here translated as “I realized” because it results from Ezekiel’s recognition of the situation around him. In Hebrew, the exclamation is repeated in the following sentence.) there were a great many bones in the valley and they were very dry."},{"number":3,"verse":"He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I said to him, “Sovereign Lord, you know.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them: ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD."},{"number":5,"verse":"This is what the sovereign LORD says to these bones: Look, I am about to infuse breath (tn Heb “I am about to bring a spirit.”) into you and you will live."},{"number":6,"verse":"I will put tendons (tn The exact physiological meaning of the term is uncertain.

I will save them from all their unfaithfulness (tc Heb “their dwellings.” The text as it stands does not make sense.

See BDB 1000 s. v. מְשׁוּבָה, and D. I. Block, Ezekiel (NICOT), 2:407.) by which they sinned.
