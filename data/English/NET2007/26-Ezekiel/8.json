In Ezekiel God’s hand being on the prophet is regularly associated with communication or a vision from God (3:14, 22; 8:1; 37:1; 40:1).) of the sovereign LORD seized me.

(tc The MT reads “fire” rather than “man,” the reading of the LXX. The nouns are very similar in Hebrew.) From his waist downward was something like fire, (tc The MT reads “what appeared to be his waist and downwards was fire.” The LXX omits “what appeared to be,” reading “from his waist to below was fire.” Suggesting that “like what appeared to be” belongs before “fire,” D. I. Block (Ezekiel [NICOT], 1:277) points out the resulting poetic symmetry of form with the next line as followed in the translation here.) and from his waist upward something like a brightness, (tc The LXX omits “like a brightness.”) like an amber glow. (tn See Ezek 1:4.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"He stretched out the form (tn The Hebrew term is normally used as an architectural term in describing the pattern of the tabernacle or temple or a representation of it (see Exod 25:8; 1 Chr 28:11).) of a hand and grabbed me by a lock of hair on my head. Then a wind (tn Or “spirit.” See note on “wind” in 2:2.) lifted me up between the earth and sky and brought me to Jerusalem (map For the location of Jerusalem see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) by means of divine visions, to the door of the inner gate which faces north where the statue (tn Or “image.”) which provokes to jealousy was located."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then I perceived that the glory of the God of Israel was there, as in the vision I had seen earlier in the valley."},{"number":5,"verse":"He said to me, “Son of man, look up toward (tn Heb “lift your eyes (to) the way of.”) the north.” So I looked up toward the north, and I noticed to the north of the altar gate was this statue of jealousy at the entrance."},{"number":6,"verse":"He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing — the great abominations that the people (tn Heb “house.”) of Israel are practicing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary?

I noticed every figure (tn Or “pattern.”) of creeping thing and beast — detestable images (tn Heb “detestable.” The word is often used to describe the figures of foreign gods.) — and every idol of the house of Israel, engraved on the wall all around.

The LORD has abandoned the land!’”"},{"number":13,"verse":"He said to me, “You will see them practicing even greater abominations!”"},{"number":14,"verse":"Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the LORD’s house. I noticed (tn Given the context this could be understood as a shock, e. g., idiomatically “Good grief! I saw….”) women sitting there weeping for Tammuz.

The practice was observed by women in the ancient Near East over a period of centuries.)"},{"number":15,"verse":"He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man?

This is the location where Zechariah was murdered (Matt 23:35).) were about twenty-five (tc The LXX reads “twenty” instead of twenty-five, perhaps because of the association of the number twenty with the Mesopotamian sun god Shamash. tn Or “exactly twenty-five.”) men with their backs to the LORD’s temple, (sn The temple faced east.) facing east — they were worshiping the sun (tn Or “the sun god.” sn The worship of astral entities may have begun during the reign of Manasseh (2 Kgs 21:5).) toward the east!"},{"number":17,"verse":"He said to me, “Do you see, son of man? Is it a trivial thing that the house of Judah commits these abominations they are practicing here? For they have filled the land with violence and provoked me to anger still further. Look, they are putting the branch to their nose! (tn It is not clear what the practice of “holding a branch to the nose” indicates. A possible parallel is the Syrian relief of a king holding a flower to his nose as he worships the stars (ANEP 281). See L. C. Allen, Ezekiel (WBC), 1:145-46. The LXX glosses the expression as “Behold, they are like mockers.”)"},{"number":18,"verse":"Therefore I will act with fury!
