The Masoretes typically wrote a mappiq in the he for the pronominal suffix but apparently missed this one. sn I ate it.

The translation “diamond” attempts to reflect this distinction in English.) Do not fear them or be terrified of the looks they give you, (tn Heb “of their faces.”) for they are a rebellious house.”"},{"number":10,"verse":"And he said to me, “Son of man, take all my words that I speak to you to heart and listen carefully."},{"number":11,"verse":"Go to the exiles, to your fellow countrymen, (tn Heb “to the sons of your people.”) and speak to them — say to them, ‘This is what the sovereign LORD says,’ whether they pay attention or not.”"},{"number":12,"verse":"Ezekiel Before the Exiles Then a wind lifted me up (sn See note on “wind” in 2:2.) and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me as the glory of the LORD rose from its place, (tc This translation accepts the emendation suggested in BHS of בְּרוּם (bÿrum) for בָּרוּךְ (barukh).

I went bitterly, (tn The traditional interpretation is that Ezekiel embarked on his mission with bitterness and anger, either reflecting God’s attitude toward the sinful people or his own feelings about having to carry out such an unpleasant task. L. C. Allen (Ezekiel [WBC], 1:13) takes “bitterly” as a misplaced marginal note and understands the following word, normally translated “anger,” in the sense of fervor or passion. He translates, “I was passionately moved” (p. 4). Another option is to take the word translated “bitterly” as a verb meaning “strengthened” (attested in Ugaritic). See G. R. Driver, Canaanite Myths and Legends, 152.) my spirit full of fury, and the hand of the LORD rested powerfully (tn Heb “the hand of the Lord was on me heavily.” The “hand of the Lord” is a metaphor for his power or influence; the modifier conveys intensity. sn In Ezekiel God’s “hand” being on the prophet is regularly associated with communication or a vision from God (1:3; 3:14, 22; 8:1; 37:1; 40:1).) on me."},{"number":15,"verse":"I came to the exiles at Tel Abib, (sn The name “Tel Abib” is a transliteration of an Akkadian term meaning “mound of the flood,” i. e., an ancient mound.
