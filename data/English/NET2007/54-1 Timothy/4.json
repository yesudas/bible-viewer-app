(tn Or “branded.” The Greek verb καυστηριάζω (kausthriazw) can be used to refer either to the cause (“brand”) or the effect (“seared”). sn Consciences are seared. The precise meaning of this phrase is somewhat debated. Three primary interpretations are (1) the consciences of these false teachers are “branded” with Satan’s mark to indicate ownership, (2) their consciences are “branded” with a penal mark to show they are lawbreakers, or (3) their consciences have been “seared” (i. e., totally burnt and desensitized) so that they are unable to notice the difference between right and wrong.

Knight, Pastoral Epistles (NIGTC), 189.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"They will prohibit marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth."},{"number":4,"verse":"For every creation of God is good and no food (tn Grk “nothing.”) is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving."},{"number":5,"verse":"For it is sanctified by God’s word and by prayer."},{"number":6,"verse":"By pointing out such things to the brothers and sisters, (tn Grk “brothers,” but the Greek word may be used for “brothers and sisters” or “fellow Christians” as here (cf.

The reading from the verb ἀγωνίζομαι (agwnizomai) has slightly better external credentials, but this verb is found in the corpus Paulinum five other times, twice in the Pastorals (1 Tim 6:12; 2 Tim 4:7). The verb ὀνειδίζω (oneidizw) occurs only once in Paul (Rom 15:3), not at all in the Pastorals. In this instance, transcriptional and intrinsic evidence might seem to be opposed to each other. In such cases, the external evidence should be given more weight. With some hesitation, ἀγωνιζόμεθα is preferred.) because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, (tn The plural Greek term ἀνθρώπων (anqrwpwn) is used here in a generic sense, referring to both men and women, and is thus translated “people.”) especially of believers."},{"number":11,"verse":"Command and teach these things."},{"number":12,"verse":"Let no one look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in your speech, conduct, love, faithfulness, (tn Or “faith.”) and purity."},{"number":13,"verse":"Until I come, give attention to the public reading of scripture, (tn Grk “reading.” sn The public reading of scripture refers to reading the scripture out loud in the church services.
