(tc Heb “and I was from tent to tent and from tabernacle.” The words אֶל־מִשְּׁכָּן (’el-mishÿkan, “to tabernacle”) should probably be added at the end of the sentence to complete this prepositional phrase and produce symmetry with the preceding prepositional phrase. The words probably fell from the text by homoioteleuton. sn I have lived in a tent that has been in various places. The point here is that the Lord moved with the tabernacle as it moved from place to place; he did not confine himself to a particular location.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"Wherever I moved throughout Israel, I did not say (tn In the Hebrew text the statement is phrased as a rhetorical question (“Did I say?”) meaning “I did not say.”) to any of the leaders whom I appointed to care for my people Israel, (tn Heb “to one of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people.”) ‘Why have you not built me a house made from cedar?’”’"},{"number":7,"verse":"“So now, say this to my servant David: ‘This is what the LORD who commands armies (tn Traditionally, “Lord of hosts.”) says: “I took you from the pasture and from your work as a shepherd (tn Heb “and from after sheep.”) to make you a leader of my people Israel."},{"number":8,"verse":"I was with you wherever you went and I defeated (tn Heb “cut off.”) all your enemies before you.

The text appears to read literally, “and you see me like the searching of man, that which is upward,” which is nonsensical. The translation above assumes the following: (1) The Qal verb translated “you see me” is repointed as a Hiphil, “you showed me,” (2) תּוֹר (tor) is understood in the sense of “searching, exploring,” and (3) הַמַּעֲלָה (hamma’alah) is taken in a temporal sense of “that which lies beyond.” Thus one could translate, “you have shown me what men search for, what lies beyond.”) O LORD God."},{"number":18,"verse":"What more can David say (tn The word “say” is supplied in the translation for clarification.) to you?
