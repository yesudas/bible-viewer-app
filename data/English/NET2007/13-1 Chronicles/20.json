He went and besieged Rabbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab defeated Rabbah and tore it down."},{"number":2,"verse":"David took the crown from the head of their king (tc The translation follows the MT, which reads “of their king”; the LXX and Vulgate read “of Milcom” (cf. 1 Kgs 11:5). Milcom, also known as Molech, was the god of the Ammonites.) and wore it (tn Heb “and it was on the head of David.”) (its weight was a talent (sn See the note on the word “talents” in 19:6.) of gold and it was set with precious stones). He took a large amount of plunder from the city."},{"number":3,"verse":"He removed the city’s residents and made them do hard labor with saws, iron picks, and axes. (tc The Hebrew text reads “saws,” but since saws were just mentioned, it is preferable to emend מְגֵרוֹת (mÿgerot, “saws”) to מַגְזְרוֹת (magzÿrot, “axes”).)
