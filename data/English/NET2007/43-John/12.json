The adjective πιστικῆς (pistikh\") is difficult with regard to its exact meaning; some have taken it to derive from πίστις (pistis) and relate to the purity of the oil of nard. More probably it is something like a brand name, “pistic nard,” the exact significance of which has not been discovered. sn Nard or spikenard is a fragrant oil from the root and spike of the nard plant of northern India.

In the later rabbinic literature, Ecclesiastes Rabbah 7.1.1 states “The fragrance of good oil is diffused from the bedroom to the dining hall, but a good name is diffused from one end of the world to the other.” If such a saying was known in the 1st century, this might be the author’s way of indicating that Mary’s act of devotion would be spoken of throughout the entire world (compare the comment in Mark 14:9).)"},{"number":4,"verse":"But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) (sn This is a parenthetical note by the author.) said,"},{"number":5,"verse":"“Why wasn’t this oil sold for three hundred silver coins (tn Grk “three hundred denarii.” The denarius was a silver coin worth a standard day’s wage, so the value exceeded what a laborer could earn in a year (taking into account Sabbaths and feast days when no work was done).) and the money (tn The words “the money” are not in the Greek text, but are implied (as the proceeds from the sale of the perfumed oil).) given to the poor?”"},{"number":6,"verse":"(Now Judas (tn Grk “he”; the referent (Judas) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) said this not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief.

(sn This is a parenthetical note by the author. This is one of the indications in the gospels that Judas was of bad character before the betrayal of Jesus. John states that he was a thief and had responsibility for the finances of the group. More than being simply a derogatory note about Judas’ character, the inclusion of the note at this particular point in the narrative may be intended to link the frustrated greed of Judas here with his subsequent decision to betray Jesus for money. The parallel accounts in Matthew and Mark seem to indicate that after this incident Judas went away immediately and made his deal with the Jewish authorities to deliver up Jesus. Losing out on one source of sordid gain, he immediately went out and set up another.)"},{"number":7,"verse":"So Jesus said, “Leave her alone. She has kept it for the day of my burial.

The simplest way to read it would be, “Leave her alone, that she may keep it for the day of my burial.” This would imply that Mary was going to use the perfumed oil on that day, while vv. 3 and 5 seem to indicate clearly that she had already used it up. Some understand the statement as elliptical: “Leave her alone; (she did this) in order to keep it for the day of my burial.” Another alternative would be an imperatival use of ἵνα with the meaning: “Leave her alone; let her keep it.” The reading of the Byzantine text, which omits the ἵνα and substitutes a perfect tense τετήρηκεν (tethrhken), while not likely to be original, probably comes close to the meaning of the text, and that has been followed in this translation.)"},{"number":8,"verse":"For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me!” (tc A few isolated witnesses omit v. 8 (D sys), part of v. 8 (Ì75), or vv. 7–8 ({0250}).

In words familiar to every Jew, the author is indicating that at this point every messianic expectation is now at the point of realization. It is clear from the words of the psalm shouted by the crowd that Jesus is being proclaimed as messianic king. See E. Lohse, TDNT 9:682-84. sn Hosanna is an Aramaic expression that literally means, “help, I pray,” or “save, I pray.” By Jesus’ time it had become a strictly liturgical formula of praise, however, and was used as an exclamation of praise to God.)

The words the time has come recall all the previous references to “the hour” throughout the Fourth Gospel (see the note on time in 2:4).
