In this context, it appears to be a generic usage (“people”) since when Paul speaks of a remnant of faithful Israelites (“the elect,” v. 7), he is not referring to males only. It can also be argued, however, that it refers only to adult males here (“men”), perhaps as representative of all the faithful left in Israel.) who have not bent the knee to Baal.” (sn A quotation from 1 Kgs 19:18.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"So in the same way at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace."},{"number":6,"verse":"And if it is by grace, it is no longer by works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace."},{"number":7,"verse":"What then?

(sn Most interpreters see Paul as making use of a long-standing metaphor of the olive tree (the root…the branches) as a symbol for Israel. See, in this regard, Jer 11:16, 19. A. T. Hanson, Studies in Paul’s Technique and Theology, 121-24, cites rabbinic use of the figure of the olive tree, and goes so far as to argue that Rom 11:17–24 is a midrash on Jer 11:16–19.)"},{"number":17,"verse":"Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and participated in (tn Grk “became a participant of.”) the richness of the olive root,"},{"number":18,"verse":"do not boast over the branches.

Neither interpretation is conclusive from a grammatical standpoint, and in fact the two may not be mutually exclusive. Some, like H. Hübner, who argue strongly against the temporal reading, nevertheless continue to give the phrase a temporal significance, saying that God will save all Israel in the end (Gottes Ich und Israel [FRLANT], 118).) all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The Deliverer will come out of Zion; he will remove ungodliness from Jacob."},{"number":27,"verse":"And this is my covenant with them, (sn A quotation from Isa 59:20–21.) when I take away their sins.” (sn A quotation from Isa 27:9; Jer 31:33–34.)"},{"number":28,"verse":"In regard to the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but in regard to election they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers."},{"number":29,"verse":"For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable."},{"number":30,"verse":"Just as you were formerly disobedient to God, but have now received mercy due to their disobedience,"},{"number":31,"verse":"so they too have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now (tc Some important Alexandrian and Western mss (א B D*, c 1506 pc bo) read νῦν (nun, “now”) here.

External evidence slightly favors omission with good representatives from the major texttypes, and because of the alliance of Alexandrian and Byzantine mss (with the Byzantine going against its normal tendency to embrace the longer reading).

However, it seems much more likely that they would have deleted it because of its seeming inappropriateness in this context.
