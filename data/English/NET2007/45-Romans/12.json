See ExSyn 618-19. sn Taken as predicate adjectives, the terms alive, holy, and pleasing are showing how unusual is the sacrifice that believers can now offer, for OT sacrifices were dead.

At the same time, the passive could well be a “permissive passive,” suggesting that there may be some consciousness of the conformity taking place.
