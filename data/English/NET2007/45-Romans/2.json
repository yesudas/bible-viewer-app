There have been several major approaches to the chapter and the group(s) it refers to: (1) Rom 2:14 refers to Gentile Christians, not Gentiles who obey the Jewish law. (2) Paul in Rom 2 is presenting a hypothetical viewpoint: If anyone could obey the law, that person would be justified, but no one can. (3) The reference to “the ones who do the law” in 2:13 are those who “do” the law in the right way, on the basis of faith, not according to Jewish legalism. (4) Rom 2:13 only speaks about Christians being judged in the future, along with such texts as Rom 14:10 and 2 Cor 5:10. (5) Paul’s material in Rom 2 is drawn heavily from Diaspora Judaism, so that the treatment of the law presented here cannot be harmonized with other things Paul says about the law elsewhere (E. P. Sanders, Paul, the Law, and the Jewish People, 123); another who sees Rom 2 as an example of Paul’s inconsistency in his treatment of the law is H. Räisänen, Paul and the Law [WUNT], 101-9. (6) The list of blessings and curses in Deut 27–30 provide the background for Rom 2; the Gentiles of 2:14 are Gentile Christians, but the condemnation of Jews in 2:17–24 addresses the failure of Jews as a nation to keep the law as a whole (A. Ito, “Romans 2: A Deuteronomistic Reading,” JSNT 59 [1995]: 21-37).) Therefore (tn Some interpreters (e. g., C. K. Barrett, Romans [HNTC], 43) connect the inferential Διό (dio, “therefore”) with 1:32a, treating 1:32b as a parenthetical comment by Paul.) you are without excuse, (tn That is, “you have nothing to say in your own defense” (so translated by TCNT).) whoever you are, (tn Grk “O man.”) when you judge someone else.

Exactly what Paul means by the term has been the subject of much scholarly debate. According to J. A. Fitzmyer (Romans [AB], 131-35; 305-6) there are at least four different senses: (1) figurative, as a “principle”; (2) generic, meaning “a law”; (3) as a reference to the OT or some part of the OT; and (4) as a reference to the Mosaic law. This last usage constitutes the majority of Paul’s references to “law” in Romans.) will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law."},{"number":13,"verse":"For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous before God, but those who do the law will be declared righteous.

Marcus has suggested that the terms used for circumcision (περιτομή, peritomh) and uncircumcision (ἀκροβυστία, akrobustia) were probably derogatory slogans used by Jews and Gentiles to describe their opponents (“The Circumcision and the Uncircumcision in Rome,” NTS 35 [1989]: 77-80).) has its value if you practice the law, but (tn This contrast is clearer and stronger in Greek than can be easily expressed in English.) if you break the law, (tn Grk “if you should be a transgressor of the law.”) your circumcision has become uncircumcision."},{"number":26,"verse":"Therefore if the uncircumcised man obeys (tn The Greek word φυλάσσω (fulassw, traditionally translated “keep”) in this context connotes preservation of and devotion to an object as well as obedience.) the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?"},{"number":27,"verse":"And will not the physically uncircumcised man (tn Grk “the uncircumcision by nature.” The word “man” is supplied here to make clear that male circumcision (or uncircumcision) is in view.) who keeps the law judge you who, despite (tn Grk “through,” but here the preposition seems to mean “(along) with,” “though provided with,” as BDAG 224 s. v. διά A.3. c indicates.) the written code (tn Grk “letter.”) and circumcision, transgress the law?"},{"number":28,"verse":"For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision something that is outward in the flesh,"},{"number":29,"verse":"but someone is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart (sn On circumcision is of the heart see Lev 26:41; Deut 10:16; Jer 4:4; Ezek 44:9.) by the Spirit (tn Some have taken the phrase ἐν πνεύματι (en pneumati, “by/in [the] S/spirit”) not as a reference to the Holy Spirit, but referring to circumcision as “spiritual and not literal” (RSV).) and not by the written code.
