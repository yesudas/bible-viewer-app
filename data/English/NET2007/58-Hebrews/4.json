{"bibleAbbr":"NET2007","bookName":"Hebrews","bookEnglishName":"Hebrews","chapterNumber":4,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"God’s Promised Rest Therefore we must be wary (tn Grk “let us fear.”) that, while the promise of entering his rest remains open, none of you may seem to have come short of it."},{"number":2,"verse":"For we had good news proclaimed to us just as they did. But the message they heard did them no good, since they did not join in (tn Or “they were not united.”) with those who heard it in faith. (tc A few mss (א and a few versional witnesses) have the nominative singular participle συγκεκερασμένος (sunkekerasmeno\", “since it [the message] was not combined with faith by those who heard it”), a reading that refers back to the ὁ λόγος (Jo logo\", “the message”). There are a few other variants here (e. g., συγκεκεραμμένοι [sunkekerammenoi] in 104, συγκεκεραμένους [sunkekeramenou\"] in 1881 Ï), but the accusative plural participle συγκεκερασμένους (sunkekerasmenou\"), found in Ì13vid,46 A B C D* Ψ 0243 0278 33 81 1739 2464 pc, has by far the best external credentials. This participle agrees with the previous ἐκείνους (ekeinou\", “those”), a more difficult construction grammatically than the nominative singular. Thus, both on external and internal grounds, συγκεκερασμένους is preferred.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, “As I swore in my anger, ‘They will never enter my rest!’” (sn A quotation from Ps 95:11.) And yet God’s works (tn Grk “although the works,” continuing the previous reference to God. The referent (God) is specified in the translation for clarity.) were accomplished from the foundation of the world."},{"number":4,"verse":"For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,” (sn A quotation from Gen 2:2.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"but to repeat the text cited earlier: (tn Grk “and in this again.”) “They will never enter my rest!”"},{"number":6,"verse":"Therefore it remains for some to enter it, yet those to whom it was previously proclaimed did not enter because of disobedience."},{"number":7,"verse":"So God (tn Grk “he”; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) again ordains a certain day, “Today,” speaking through David (sn Ps 95 does not mention David either in the text or the superscription. It is possible that the writer of Hebrews is attributing the entire collection of psalms to David (although some psalms are specifically attributed to other individuals or groups).) after so long a time, as in the words quoted before, (tn Grk “as it has been said before” (see Heb 3:7).) “O, that today you would listen as he speaks! (tn Grk “today if you hear his voice.”) Do not harden your hearts.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"For if Joshua had given them rest, God (tn Grk “he”; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) would not have spoken afterward about another day."},{"number":9,"verse":"Consequently a Sabbath rest remains for the people of God."},{"number":10,"verse":"For the one who enters God’s (tn Grk “his”; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) rest has also rested from his works, just as God did from his own works."},{"number":11,"verse":"Thus we must make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of disobedience."},{"number":12,"verse":"For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing even to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart."},{"number":13,"verse":"And no creature is hidden from God, (tn Grk “him”; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) but everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must render an account."},{"number":14,"verse":"Jesus Our Compassionate High Priest Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession."},{"number":15,"verse":"For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin."},{"number":16,"verse":"Therefore let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace whenever we need help.
