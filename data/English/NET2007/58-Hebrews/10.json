BDAG 468 s. v. ἰδού 2).) I have come — it is written of me in the scroll of the book — to do your will, O God.’” (sn A quotation from Ps 40:6–8 (LXX). The phrase a body you prepared for me (in v. 5) is apparently an interpretive expansion of the HT reading “ears you have dug out for me.”)"},{"number":8,"verse":"When he says above, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you did not desire nor did you take delight in them” (sn Various phrases from the quotation of Ps 40:6 in Heb 10:5–6 are repeated in Heb 10:8.) (which are offered according to the law),"},{"number":9,"verse":"then he says, “Here I am: I have come to do your will.” (tc The majority of mss, especially the later ones (א2 0278vid 1739 Ï lat), have ὁ θεός (Jo qeo\", “God”) at this point, while most of the earliest and best witnesses lack such an explicit addressee (so Ì46 א* A C D K P Ψ 33 1175 1881 2464 al). The longer reading is a palpable corruption, apparently motivated in part by the wording of Ps 40:8 (39:9 LXX) and by the word order of this same verse as quoted in Heb 10:7.) He does away with (tn Or “abolishes.”) the first to establish the second."},{"number":10,"verse":"By his will (tn Grk “by which will.” Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.) we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."},{"number":11,"verse":"And every priest stands day after day (tn Or “daily,” “every day.”) serving and offering the same sacrifices again and again — sacrifices that can never take away sins."},{"number":12,"verse":"But when this priest (tn Grk “this one.” This pronoun refers to Jesus, but “this priest” was used in the translation to make the contrast between the Jewish priests in v. 11 and Jesus as a priest clearer in English.) had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, he sat down at the right hand (sn An allusion to Ps 110:1.) of God,"},{"number":13,"verse":"where he is now waiting (tn Grk “from then on waiting.”) until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet.

In a bold shift the writer changes from a spatial phrase (Christ opened the way through the curtain into the inner sanctuary) to an instrumental phrase (he did this through [by means of] his flesh in his sacrifice of himself), associating the two in an allusion to the splitting of the curtain in the temple from top to bottom (Matt 27:51; Mark 15:38; Luke 23:45). Just as the curtain was split, so Christ’s body was broken for us, to give us access into God’s presence.)"},{"number":21,"verse":"and since we have a great priest (tn Grk “and a great priest,” continuing the construction begun in v. 19.) over the house of God,"},{"number":22,"verse":"let us draw near with a sincere heart in the assurance that faith brings, (tn Grk “in assurance of faith.”) because we have had our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience (sn The phrase our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience combines the OT imagery of the sprinkling with blood to give ritual purity with the emphasis on the interior cleansing provided by the new covenant: It is the heart that is cleansed and the conscience made perfect (cf. Heb 8:10; 9:9, 14; 10:2, 16).) and our bodies washed in pure water."},{"number":23,"verse":"And let us hold unwaveringly to the hope that we confess, for the one who made the promise is trustworthy."},{"number":24,"verse":"And let us take thought of how to spur one another on to love and good works, (tn Grk “let us consider one another for provoking of love and good deeds.”)"},{"number":25,"verse":"not abandoning our own meetings, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and even more so because you see the day (sn The day refers to that well-known time of Christ’s coming and judgment in the future; see a similar use of “day” in 1 Cor 3:13.) drawing near. (tn This paragraph (vv. 19–25) is actually a single, skillfully composed sentence in Greek, but it must be broken into shorter segments for English idiom. It begins with several subordinate phrases (since we have confidence and a great priest), has three parallel exhortations as its main verbs (let us draw near, hold, and take thought), and concludes with several subordinate phrases related to the final exhortation (not abandoning but encouraging).)"},{"number":26,"verse":"For if we deliberately keep on sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins is left for us, (tn Grk “is left,” with “for us” implied by the first half of the verse.)"},{"number":27,"verse":"but only a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury (tn Grk “zeal,” recalling God’s jealous protection of his holiness and honor (cf.

Phil 1:7; Col 4:18). It may have been generated by the reading δεσμοῖς without the μου (so Ì46 Ψ 104 pc), the force of which is so ambiguous (lit., “you shared the sufferings with the bonds”) as to be virtually nonsensical. Most likely, δεσμοῖς resulted when a scribe made an error in copying δεσμίοις (desmioi\"), a reading which makes excellent sense (“[of] those in prison”) and is strongly supported by early and significant witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western texttypes (A D* H 6 33 81 1739 lat sy co). Thus, δεσμίοις best explains the rise of the other readings on both internal and external grounds and is strongly preferred.) and you accepted the confiscation of your belongings with joy, because you knew that you certainly (tn Grk “you yourselves.”) had a better and lasting possession."},{"number":35,"verse":"So do not throw away your confidence, because it (tn Grk “which,” but showing the reason.) has great reward."},{"number":36,"verse":"For you need endurance in order to do God’s will and so receive what is promised.
