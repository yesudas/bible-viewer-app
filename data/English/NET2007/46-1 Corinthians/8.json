We are no worse if we do not eat and no better if we do."},{"number":9,"verse":"But be careful that this liberty of yours does not become a hindrance to the weak."},{"number":10,"verse":"For if someone weak sees you who possess knowledge dining in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience be “strengthened” (tn Or “built up”; This is the same word used in v. 1b.
