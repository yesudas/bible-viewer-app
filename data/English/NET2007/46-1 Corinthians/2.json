I did not come with superior eloquence or wisdom as I proclaimed the testimony (tc ‡ A few important mss (Ì46vid א* A C pc as well as some versions and fathers) read μυστήριον (musthrion, “mystery”) instead of μαρτύριον (marturion, “testimony”). But the latter has wider ms support (א2 B D F G Ψ 33 1739 1881 Ï and some versions), though not quite as impressive. μαρτύριον may have been changed by scribes in anticipation of Paul’s words in 2:7, or conversely, μυστήριον may have been changed to conform to 1:6. Transcriptionally, since “the mystery of God/Christ” is a well-worn expression in the corpus Paulinum (1 Cor 2:7; 4:1; Eph 3:4; Col 2:2; 4:3), while “testimony of Christ” occurs in Paul only once (1 Cor 1:6, though “testimony of the Lord” appears in 2 Tim 1:8), and “testimony of God” never, it is likely that scribes changed the text to the more usual expression. A decision is difficult in this instance, but a slight preference should be given to μαρτύριον.) of God."},{"number":2,"verse":"For I decided to be concerned about nothing (tn Grk “to know nothing.”) among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified."},{"number":3,"verse":"And I was with you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling."},{"number":4,"verse":"My conversation and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,"},{"number":5,"verse":"so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on the power of God."},{"number":6,"verse":"Wisdom from God Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, (tn In extrabiblical literature this word was applied to an initiate of a mystery religion (BDAG 995 s. v. τέλειος 3, gives numerous examples and states this was a technical term of the mystery religions).
