{"bibleAbbr":"NET2007","bookName":"Genesis","bookEnglishName":"Genesis","chapterNumber":37,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"Joseph’s Dreams But Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, (tn Heb “the land of the sojournings of his father.”) in the land of Canaan. (sn The next section begins with the heading This is the account of Jacob in Gen 37:2, so this verse actually forms part of the preceding section as a concluding contrast with Esau and his people. In contrast to all the settled and expanded population of Esau, Jacob was still moving about in the land without a permanent residence and without kings. Even if the Edomite king list was added later (as the reference to kings in Israel suggests), its placement here in contrast to Jacob and his descendants is important. Certainly the text deals with Esau before dealing with Jacob – that is the pattern. But the detail is so great in chap. 36 that the contrast cannot be missed.)"},{"number":2,"verse":"This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, his seventeen-year-old son, (tn Heb “a son of seventeen years.” The word “son” is in apposition to the name “Joseph.”) was taking care of (tn Or “tending”; Heb “shepherding” or “feeding.”) the flocks with his brothers. Now he was a youngster (tn Or perhaps “a helper.” The significance of this statement is unclear. It may mean “now the lad was with,” or it may suggest Joseph was like a servant to them.) working with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. (tn Heb “and he [was] a young man with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, the wives of his father.”) Joseph brought back a bad report about them (tn Heb “their bad report.” The pronoun is an objective genitive, specifying that the bad or damaging report was about the brothers. sn Some interpreters portray Joseph as a tattletale for bringing back a bad report about them [i. e., his brothers], but the entire Joseph story has some of the characteristics of wisdom literature. Joseph is presented in a good light – not because he was perfect, but because the narrative is showing how wisdom rules. In light of that, this section portrays Joseph as faithful to his father in little things, even though unpopular – and so he will eventually be given authority over greater things.) to their father."},{"number":3,"verse":"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons (tn The disjunctive clause provides supplemental information vital to the story. It explains in part the brothers’ animosity toward Joseph. sn The statement Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons brings forward a motif that played an important role in the family of Isaac – parental favoritism. Jacob surely knew what that had done to him and his brother Esau, and to his own family. But now he showers affection on Rachel’s son Joseph.) because he was a son born to him late in life, (tn Heb “a son of old age was he to him.” This expression means “a son born to him when he [i. e., Jacob] was old.”) and he made a special (tn It is not clear what this tunic was like, because the meaning of the Hebrew word that describes it is uncertain. The idea that it was a coat of many colors comes from the Greek translation of the OT. An examination of cognate terms in Semitic suggests it was either a coat or tunic with long sleeves (cf. NEB, NRSV), or a tunic that was richly embroidered (cf. NIV). It set Joseph apart as the favored one.) tunic for him."},{"number":4,"verse":"When Joseph’s (tn Heb “his”; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, (tn Heb “of his brothers.” This is redundant in contemporary English and has been replaced in the translation by the pronoun “them.”) they hated Joseph (tn Heb “him”; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) and were not able to speak to him kindly. (tn Heb “speak to him for peace.”)"},{"number":5,"verse":"Joseph (tn Heb “and he”; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) had a dream, (tn Heb “dreamed a dream.”) and when he told his brothers about it, (sn Some interpreters see Joseph as gloating over his brothers, but the text simply says he told his brothers about it (i. e., the dream). The text gives no warrant for interpreting his manner as arrogant or condescending. It seems normal that he would share a dream with the family.) they hated him even more. (tn The construction uses a hendiadys, “they added to hate,” meaning they hated him even more.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had: (tn Heb “hear this dream which I dreamed.”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"There we were, (tn All three clauses in this dream report begin with וְהִנֵּה (vÿhinneh, “and look”), which lends vividness to the report. This is represented in the translation by the expression “there we were.”) binding sheaves of grain in the middle of the field. Suddenly my sheaf rose up and stood upright and your sheaves surrounded my sheaf and bowed down (tn The verb means “to bow down to the ground.” It is used to describe worship and obeisance to masters.) to it!”"},{"number":8,"verse":"Then his brothers asked him, “Do you really think you will rule over us or have dominion over us?” (tn Heb “Ruling, will you rule over us, or reigning, will you reign over us?” The statement has a poetic style, with the two questions being in synonymous parallelism. Both verbs in this statement are preceded by the infinitive absolute, which lends emphasis. It is as if Joseph’s brothers said, “You don’t really think you will rule over us, do you? You don’t really think you will have dominion over us, do you?”) They hated him even more (tn This construction is identical to the one in Gen 37:5.) because of his dream and because of what he said. (sn The response of Joseph’s brothers is understandable, given what has already been going on in the family. But here there is a hint of uneasiness – they hated him because of his dream and because of his words. The dream bothered them, as well as his telling them. And their words in the rhetorical question are ironic, for this is exactly what would happen. The dream was God’s way of revealing it.)"},{"number":9,"verse":"Then he had another dream, (tn Heb “And he dreamed yet another dream.”) and told it to his brothers. “Look,” (tn Heb “and he said, ‘Look.’” The order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse have been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons. Both clauses of the dream report begin with הִנֵּה (hinneh, “look”), which lends vividness to the report.) he said. “I had another dream. The sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”"},{"number":10,"verse":"When he told his father and his brothers, his father rebuked him, saying, “What is this dream that you had? (sn The question What is this dream that you had? expresses Jacob’s dismay at what he perceives to be Joseph’s audacity.) Will I, your mother, and your brothers really come and bow down to you?” (tn Heb “Coming, will we come, I and your mother and your brothers, to bow down to you to the ground?” The verb “come” is preceded by the infinitive absolute, which lends emphasis. It is as if Jacob said, “You don’t really think we will come…to bow down…do you?”)"},{"number":11,"verse":"His brothers were jealous (sn Joseph’s brothers were already jealous of him, but this made it even worse. Such jealousy easily leads to action, as the next episode in the story shows. Yet dreams were considered a form of revelation, and their jealousy was not only of the favoritism of their father, but of the dreams. This is why Jacob kept the matter in mind.) of him, but his father kept in mind what Joseph said.

Throw him into this cistern that is here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him.” (sn The verbs translated shed, throw, and lay sound alike in Hebrew; the repetition of similar sounds draws attention to Reuben’s words.)
