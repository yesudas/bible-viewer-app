Lot was sitting in the city’s gateway. (tn Heb “sitting in the gate of Sodom.” The phrase “the gate of Sodom” has been translated “the city’s gateway” for stylistic reasons. sn The expression sitting in the city’s gateway may mean that Lot was exercising some type of judicial function (see the use of the idiom in 2 Sam 19:8; Jer 26:10; 38:7; 39:3).) When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face toward the ground."},{"number":2,"verse":"He said, “Here, my lords, please turn aside to your servant’s house. Stay the night (tn The imperatives have the force of invitation.) and wash your feet. Then you can be on your way early in the morning.” (tn These two verbs form a verbal hendiadys: “you can rise up early and go” means “you can go early.”) “No,” they replied, “we’ll spend the night in the town square.” (sn The town square refers to the wide street area at the gate complex of the city.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"But he urged (tn The Hebrew verb פָּצַר (patsar, “to press, to insist”) ironically foreshadows the hostile actions of the men of the city (see v. 9, where the verb also appears).

He prepared a feast for them, including bread baked without yeast, and they ate."},{"number":4,"verse":"Before they could lie down to sleep, (tn The verb שָׁכַב (shakhav) means “to lie down, to recline,” that is, “to go to bed.” Here what appears to be an imperfect is a preterite after the adverb טֶרֶם (terem). The nuance of potential (perfect) fits well.) all the men — both young and old, from every part of the city of Sodom — surrounded the house. (tn Heb “and the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, from the young to the old, all the people from the end [of the city].” The repetition of the phrase “men of” stresses all kinds of men.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"They shouted to Lot, (tn The Hebrew text adds “and said to him.” This is redundant in English and has not been translated for stylistic reasons.) “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can have sex (tn The Hebrew verb יָדַע (yada’, “to know”) is used here in the sense of “to lie with” or “to have sex with” (as in Gen 4:1). That this is indeed the meaning is clear from Lot’s warning that they not do so wickedly, and his willingness to give them his daughters instead. sn The sin of the men of Sodom is debated. The fact that the sin involved a sexual act (see note on the phrase “have sex” in 19:5) precludes an association of the sin with inhospitality as is sometimes asserted (see W. Roth, “What of Sodom and Gomorrah? Homosexual Acts in the Old Testament,” Explor 1 [1974]: 7-14). The text at a minimum condemns forced sexual intercourse, i. e., rape. Other considerations, though, point to a condemnation of homosexual acts more generally. The narrator emphasizes the fact that the men of Sodom wanted to have sex with men: They demand that Lot release the angelic messengers (seen as men) to them for sex, and when Lot offers his daughters as a substitute they refuse them and attempt to take the angelic messengers by force. In addition the wider context of the Pentateuch condemns homosexual acts as sin (see, e. g., Lev 18:22). Thus a reading of this text within its narrative context, both immediate and broad, condemns not only the attempted rape but also the attempted homosexual act.) with them!”"},{"number":6,"verse":"Lot went outside to them, shutting the door behind him."},{"number":7,"verse":"He said, “No, my brothers!

Let me bring them out to you, and you can do to them whatever you please. (tn Heb “according to what is good in your eyes.”) Only don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection (tn Heb “shadow.”) of my roof.” (sn This chapter portrays Lot as a hypocrite. He is well aware of the way the men live in his city and is apparently comfortable in the midst of it. But when confronted by the angels, he finally draws the line. But he is nevertheless willing to sacrifice his daughters’ virginity to protect his guests. His opposition to the crowds leads to his rejection as a foreigner by those with whom he had chosen to live. The one who attempted to rescue his visitors ends up having to be rescued by them.)"},{"number":9,"verse":"“Out of our way!” (tn Heb “approach out there” which could be rendered “Get out of the way, stand back!”) they cried, and “This man came to live here as a foreigner, (tn Heb “to live as a resident alien.”) and now he dares to judge us! (tn Heb “and he has judged, judging.” The infinitive absolute follows the finite verbal form for emphasis. This emphasis is reflected in the translation by the phrase “dares to judge.”) We’ll do more harm (tn The verb “to do wickedly” is repeated here (see v. 7). It appears that whatever “wickedness” the men of Sodom had intended to do to Lot’s visitors – probably nothing short of homosexual rape – they were now ready to inflict on Lot.) to you than to them!” They kept (tn Heb “and they pressed against the man, against Lot, exceedingly.”) pressing in on Lot until they were close enough (tn Heb “and they drew near.”) to break down the door."},{"number":10,"verse":"So the men inside (tn Heb “the men,” referring to the angels inside Lot’s house.

The men are called “sons-in-law” (literally “the takers of his daughters”), but the daughters had not yet had sex with a man. It is better to translate the phrase “who were going to marry his daughters.” Since formal marriage contracts were binding, the husbands-to-be could already be called sons-in-law.) He said, “Quick, get out of this place because the LORD is about to destroy (tn The Hebrew active participle expresses an imminent action.) the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was ridiculing them. (tn Heb “and he was like one taunting in the eyes of his sons-in-law.” These men mistakenly thought Lot was ridiculing them and their lifestyle. Their response illustrates how morally insensitive they had become.)"},{"number":15,"verse":"At dawn (tn Heb “When dawn came up.”) the angels hurried Lot along, saying, “Get going!

Abraham had family in that area. He had rescued those people from the invasion. That was why he interceded. Yet he surely knew how wicked they were.
