(sn This account is parallel to two similar stories about Abraham (see Gen 12:10–20; 20:1–18). Many scholars do not believe there were three similar incidents, only one that got borrowed and duplicated. Many regard the account about Isaac as the original, which then was attached to the more important person, Abraham, with supernatural elements being added. For a critique of such an approach, see R. Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative, 47-62. It is more likely that the story illustrates the proverb “like father, like son” (see T. W. Mann, The Book of the Torah, 53). In typical human fashion the son follows his father’s example of lying to avoid problems. The appearance of similar events reported in a similar way underscores the fact that the blessing has now passed to Isaac, even if he fails as his father did.) Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar."},{"number":2,"verse":"The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; (sn Do not go down to Egypt. The words echo Gen 12:10, which reports that “Abram went down to Egypt,” but state the opposite.) settle down in the land that I will point out to you. (tn Heb “say to you.”)"},{"number":3,"verse":"Stay (tn The Hebrew verb גּוּר (gur) means “to live temporarily without ownership of land.” Abraham’s family will not actually possess the land of Canaan until the Israelite conquest hundreds of years later.) in this land. Then I will be with you and will bless you, (tn After the imperative “stay” the two prefixed verb forms with prefixed conjunction here indicate consequence. sn I will be with you and I will bless you. The promise of divine presence is a promise to intervene to protect and to bless.) for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, (tn The Hebrew term זֶרַע (zera’) occurring here and in v. 18 may mean “seed” (for planting), “offspring” (occasionally of animals, but usually of people), or “descendants” depending on the context. sn To you and to your descendants. The Abrahamic blessing will pass to Isaac. Everything included in that blessing will now belong to the son, and in turn will be passed on to his sons. But there is a contingency involved: If they are to enjoy the full blessings, they will have to obey the word of the Lord. And so obedience is enjoined here with the example of how well Abraham obeyed.) and I will fulfill (tn The Hiphil stem of the verb קוּם (qum) here means “to fulfill, to bring to realization.” For other examples of this use of this verb form, see Lev 26:9; Num 23:19; Deut 8:18; 9:5; 1 Sam 1:23; 1 Kgs 6:12; Jer 11:5.) the solemn promise I made (tn Heb “the oath which I swore.”sn The solemn promise I made.

All the nations of the earth will pronounce blessings on one another using the name of your descendants. (tn Traditionally the verb is taken as passive (“will be blessed”) here, as if Abraham’s descendants were going to be a channel or source of blessing to the nations. But the Hitpael is better understood here as reflexive/reciprocal, “will bless [i. e., pronounce blessings on] themselves/one another” (see also Gen 22:18). Elsewhere the Hitpael of the verb “to bless” is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 12:2 predicts that Abram will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae. For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11. Earlier formulations of this promise (see Gen 12:2; 18:18) use the Niphal stem. (See also Gen 28:14.))"},{"number":5,"verse":"All this will come to pass (tn The words “All this will come to pass” are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied for stylistic reasons.) because Abraham obeyed me (tn Heb “listened to my voice.”) and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.” (sn My charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. The language of this verse is clearly interpretive, for Abraham did not have all these laws. The terms are legal designations for sections of the Mosaic law and presuppose the existence of the law. Some Rabbinic views actually conclude that Abraham had fulfilled the whole law before it was given (see m. Qiddushin 4:14). Some scholars argue that this story could only have been written after the law was given (C. Westermann, Genesis, 2:424-25). But the simplest explanation is that the narrator (traditionally taken to be Moses the Lawgiver) elaborated on the simple report of Abraham’s obedience by using terms with which the Israelites were familiar. In this way he depicts Abraham as the model of obedience to God’s commands, whose example Israel should follow.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"So Isaac settled in Gerar."},{"number":7,"verse":"When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he replied, “She is my sister.” (sn Rebekah, unlike Sarah, was not actually her husband’s sister.) He was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” for he thought to himself, (tn Heb “lest.” The words “for he thought to himself” are supplied because the next clause is written with a first person pronoun, showing that Isaac was saying or thinking this.) “The men of this place will kill me to get (tn Heb “kill me on account of.”) Rebekah because she is very beautiful.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"After Isaac (tn Heb “and he”; the referent (Isaac) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) had been there a long time, (tn Heb “and it happened when the days were long to him there.”) Abimelech king of the Philistines happened to look out a window and observed (tn Heb “look, Isaac.” By the use of the particle הִנֵּה (hinneh, “look”), the narrator invites the audience to view the scene through Abimelech’s eyes.) Isaac caressing (tn Or “fondling.”sn The Hebrew word מְצַחֵק (mÿtsakheq), from the root צָחַק (tsakhaq, “laugh”), forms a sound play with the name “Isaac” right before it. Here it depicts an action, probably caressing or fondling, that indicated immediately that Rebekah was Isaac’s wife, not his sister. Isaac’s deception made a mockery of God’s covenantal promise. Ignoring God’s promise to protect and bless him, Isaac lied to protect himself and acted in bad faith to the men of Gerar.) his wife Rebekah."},{"number":9,"verse":"So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, “She is really (tn Heb “Surely, look!” See N.

Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac replied, “Because I thought someone might kill me to get her.” (tn Heb “Because I said, ‘Lest I die on account of her.’” Since the verb “said” probably means “said to myself” (i. e., “thought”) here, the direct discourse in the Hebrew statement has been converted to indirect discourse in the translation. In addition the simple prepositional phrase “on account of her” has been clarified in the translation as “to get her” (cf. v. 7).)"},{"number":10,"verse":"Then Abimelech exclaimed, “What in the world have you done to us?

(tn Heb “and he camped in the valley of Gerar and he lived there.”sn This valley was actually a wadi (a dry river bed where the water would flow in the rainy season, but this would have been rare in the Negev). The water table under it would have been higher than in the desert because of water soaking in during the torrents, making it easier to find water when digging wells.
