The purpose of this custom, called the levirate system, was to ensure that no line of the family would become extinct. The name of the deceased was to be maintained through this custom of having a child by the nearest relative. See M. Burrows, “Levirate Marriage in Israel,” JBL 59 (1940): 23-33.)"},{"number":9,"verse":"But Onan knew that the child (tn Heb “offspring.”) would not be considered his.

So whenever (tn The construction shows that this was a repeated practice and not merely one action. sn The text makes it clear that the purpose of the custom was to produce an heir for the deceased brother.

This clause explains that Judah had no intention of giving Shelah to Tamar for the purpose of the levirate marriage. Judah apparently knew the nature of his sons, and feared that God would be angry with the third son and kill him as well.) So Tamar went and lived in her father’s house."},{"number":12,"verse":"After some time (sn After some time. There is not enough information in the narrative to know how long this was. The text says “the days increased.” It was long enough for Shelah to mature and for Tamar to realize she would not have him.) Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. After Judah was consoled, he left for Timnah to visit his sheepshearers, along with (tn Heb “and he went up to the shearers of his sheep, he and.”) his friend Hirah the Adullamite."},{"number":13,"verse":"Tamar was told, (tn Heb “And it was told to Tamar, saying.”) “Look, your father-in-law is going up (tn The active participle indicates the action was in progress or about to begin.) to Timnah to shear his sheep.”"},{"number":14,"verse":"So she removed her widow’s clothes and covered herself with a veil. She wrapped herself and sat at the entrance to Enaim which is on the way to Timnah. (She did this because (tn The Hebrew text simply has “because,” connecting this sentence to what precedes. For stylistic reasons the words “she did this” are supplied in the translation and a new sentence begun.) she saw that she had not been given to Shelah as a wife, even though he had now grown up.) (tn Heb “she saw that Shelah had grown up, but she was not given to him as a wife.”)"},{"number":15,"verse":"When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute (tn Heb “he reckoned her for a prostitute,” which was what Tamar had intended for him to do.

The masculine form of this noun is used for male cult prostitutes. Judah thought he had gone to an ordinary prostitute (v. 15); but Hirah went looking for a cult prostitute, perhaps because it had been a sheep-shearing festival. For further discussion see E. M. Yamauchi, “Cultic Prostitution,” Orient and Occident (AOAT), 213-23.) who was at Enaim by the road?” But they replied, “There has been no cult prostitute here.”"},{"number":22,"verse":"So he returned to Judah and said, “I couldn’t find her.

NCV, NRSV, NLT “more in the right.”sn She is more upright than I. Judah had been irresponsible and unfaithful to his duty to see that the family line continued through the levirate marriage of his son Shelah. Tamar fought for her right to be the mother of Judah’s line. When she was not given Shelah and Judah’s wife died, she took action on her own to ensure that the line did not die out. Though deceptive, it was a desperate and courageous act. For Tamar it was within her rights; she did nothing that the law did not entitle her to do. But for Judah it was wrong because he thought he was going to a prostitute. See also Susan Niditch, “The Wronged Woman Righted: An Analysis of Genesis 38,” HTR 72 (1979): 143-48.) than I am, because I wouldn’t give her to Shelah my son.” He did not have sexual relations with her (tn Heb “and he did not add again to know her.” Here “know” is a euphemism for sexual intercourse.) again."},{"number":27,"verse":"When it was time for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb."},{"number":28,"verse":"While she was giving birth, one child (tn The word “child” has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.) put out his hand, and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his hand, saying, “This one came out first.”"},{"number":29,"verse":"But then he drew back his hand, and his brother came out before him. (tn Heb “Look, his brother came out.” By the use of the particle הִנֵּה (hinneh, “look”), the narrator invites the reader to view the scene through the midwife’s eyes. The words “before him” are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.) She said, “How you have broken out of the womb!” (tn Heb “How you have made a breach for yourself!” The Hebrew verb translated “make a breach” frequently occurs, as here, with a cognate accusative. The event provided the meaningful name Perez, “he who breaks through.”) So he was named Perez. (sn The name Perez means “he who breaks through,” referring to Perez reaching out his hand at birth before his brother was born. The naming signified the completion of Tamar’s struggle and also depicted the destiny of the tribe of Perez who later became dominant (Gen 46:12 and Num 26:20). Judah and his brothers had sold Joseph into slavery, thinking they could thwart God’s plan that the elder brothers should serve the younger. God demonstrated that principle through these births in Judah’s own family, affirming that the elder will serve the younger, and that Joseph’s leadership could not so easily be set aside. See J. Goldin, “The Youngest Son; or, Where Does Genesis 38 Belong?” JBL 96 (1977): 27-44.)"},{"number":30,"verse":"Afterward his brother came out — the one who had the scarlet thread on his hand — and he was named Zerah. (sn Perhaps the child was named Zerah because of the scarlet thread. Though the Hebrew word used for “scarlet thread” in v. 28 is not related to the name Zerah, there is a related root in Babylonian and western Aramaic that means “scarlet” or “scarlet thread.” In Hebrew the name appears to be derived from a root meaning “to shine.” The name could have originally meant something like “shining one” or “God has shined.” Zerah became the head of a tribe (Num 26:20) from whom Achan descended (Josh 7:1).)"}]}
