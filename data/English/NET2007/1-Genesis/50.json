(tn Heb “fell on.” The expression describes Joseph’s unrestrained sorrow over Jacob’s death; he probably threw himself across the body and embraced his father.) He wept over him and kissed him."},{"number":2,"verse":"Joseph instructed the physicians in his service (tn Heb “his servants the physicians.”) to embalm his father, so the physicians embalmed Israel."},{"number":3,"verse":"They took forty days, for that is the full time needed for embalming. (tn Heb “and forty days were fulfilled for him, for thus are fulfilled the days of embalming.”) The Egyptians mourned (tn Heb “wept.”) for him seventy days. (sn Seventy days. This probably refers to a time of national mourning.)"},{"number":4,"verse":"When the days of mourning (tn Heb “weeping.”) had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s royal court, (tn Heb “the house of Pharaoh.”) “If I have found favor in your sight, please say to Pharaoh, (tn Heb “in the ears of Pharaoh.”)"},{"number":5,"verse":"‘My father made me swear an oath.

(tn Heb “camp.”)"},{"number":10,"verse":"When they came to the threshing floor of Atad (sn The location of the threshing floor of Atad is not certain. The expression the other side of the Jordan could refer to the eastern or western bank, depending on one’s perspective. However, it is commonly used in the OT for Transjordan. This would suggest that the entourage came up the Jordan Valley and crossed into the land at Jericho, just as the Israelites would in the time of Joshua.) on the other side of the Jordan, they mourned there with very great and bitter sorrow. (tn Heb “and they mourned there [with] very great and heavy mourning.” The cognate accusative, as well as the two adjectives and the adverb, emphasize the degree of their sorrow.)

But God will surely come to you (tn The verb פָּקַד (paqad) means “to visit,” i. e., to intervene for blessing or cursing; here Joseph announces that God would come to fulfill the promises by delivering them from Egypt. The statement is emphasized by the use of the infinitive absolute with the verb: “God will surely visit you.”) and lead you up from this land to the land he swore on oath to give (tn The words “to give” are supplied in the translation for clarity and for stylistic reasons.) to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”"},{"number":25,"verse":"Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath.
