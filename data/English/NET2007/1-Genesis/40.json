A. Kitchen, NBD3 248). Nehemiah held this post in Persia.) to the king of Egypt and the royal baker (sn The baker may be the Egyptian retehti, the head of the bakers, who had privileges in the royal court.) offended (sn The Hebrew verb translated offended here is the same one translated “sin” in 39:9. Perhaps there is an intended contrast between these officials, who deserve to be imprisoned, and Joseph, who refused to sin against God, but was thrown into prison in spite of his innocence.) their master, the king of Egypt."},{"number":2,"verse":"Pharaoh was enraged with his two officials, (tn The Hebrew word סָרִיס (saris), used here of these two men and of Potiphar (see 39:1), normally means “eunuch.” But evidence from Akkadian texts shows that in early times the title was used of a court official in general. Only later did it become more specialized in its use.) the cupbearer and the baker,"},{"number":3,"verse":"so he imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard in the same facility where Joseph was confined."},{"number":4,"verse":"The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be their attendant, and he served them.

(tn The verb זָעַף (za’af) only occurs here and Dan 1:10.
