The point of Jacob’s question is that his sons should be going to get grain rather than sitting around doing nothing. Jacob, as the patriarch, still makes the decisions for the whole clan.)"},{"number":2,"verse":"He then said, “Look, I hear that there is grain in Egypt.

(tn The disjunctive clause either introduces a new episode in the unfolding drama or provides the reader with supplemental information necessary to understanding the story.) Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down (sn Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down before him. Here is the beginning of the fulfillment of Joseph’s dreams (see Gen 37). But it is not the complete fulfillment, since all his brothers and his parents must come. The point of the dream, of course, was not simply to get the family to bow to Joseph, but that Joseph would be placed in a position of rule and authority to save the family and the world (41:57).) before him with (tn The word “faces” is an adverbial accusative, so the preposition has been supplied in the translation.) their faces to the ground."},{"number":7,"verse":"When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger (sn But pretended to be a stranger. Joseph intends to test his brothers to see if they have changed and have the integrity to be patriarchs of the tribes of Israel. He will do this by putting them in the same situations that they and he were in before. The first test will be to awaken their conscience.) to them and spoke to them harshly. He asked, “Where do you come from?” They answered, (tn Heb “said.”) “From the land of Canaan, to buy grain for food.” (tn The verb is denominative, meaning “to buy grain”; the word “food” could simply be the direct object, but may also be an adverbial accusative.)"},{"number":8,"verse":"Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him."},{"number":9,"verse":"Then Joseph remembered (sn You are spies.

Joseph uses an oath formula to let the brothers know the certainty of what he said. There is some discussion in the commentaries on swearing by the life of Pharaoh, but since the formulation here reflects the Hebrew practice, it would be hard to connect the ideas exactly to Egyptian practices. Joseph did this to make the point in a way that his Hebrew brothers would understand. See M. R.

(sn For I fear God. Joseph brings God into the picture to awaken his brothers’ consciences. The godly person cares about the welfare of people, whether they live or die.

So now we must pay for shedding his blood!” (tn Heb “and also his blood, look, it is required.” God requires compensation, as it were, from those who shed innocent blood (see Gen 9:6). In other words, God exacts punishment for the crime of murder.)"},{"number":23,"verse":"(Now (tn The disjunctive clause provides supplemental information that is important to the story.) they did not know that Joseph could understand them, (tn “was listening.” The brothers were not aware that Joseph could understand them as they spoke the preceding words in their native language.) for he was speaking through an interpreter.)

His orders were carried out. (tn Heb “and he did for them so.” Joseph would appear to be the subject of the singular verb. If the text is retained, the statement seems to be a summary of the preceding, more detailed statement. However, some read the verb as plural, “and they did for them so.” In this case the statement indicates that Joseph’s subordinates carried out his orders. Another alternative is to read the singular verb as passive (with unspecified subject), “and this was done for them so” (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV).)"},{"number":26,"verse":"So they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.

(tn Heb “and look, it [was] in the mouth of his sack.” By the use of the particle הִנֵּה (hinneh, “look”), the narrator invites the reader to look through the eyes of the character and thereby draws attention to the money.)"},{"number":28,"verse":"He said to his brothers, “My money was returned! Here it is in my sack!” They were dismayed; (tn Heb “and their heart went out.” Since this expression is used only here, the exact meaning is unclear. The following statement suggests that it may refer to a sudden loss of emotional strength, so “They were dismayed” adequately conveys the meaning (cf. NRSV); NIV has “Their hearts sank.”) they turned trembling one to another (tn Heb “and they trembled, a man to his neighbor.”) and said, “What in the world has God done to us?” (tn Heb “What is this God has done to us?” The demonstrative pronoun (“this”) adds emphasis to the question.)"},{"number":29,"verse":"They returned to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan and told him all the things that had happened to them, saying,"},{"number":30,"verse":"“The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and treated us (tn Heb “made us.”) as if we were (tn The words “if we were” have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.) spying on the land."},{"number":31,"verse":"But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies!"},{"number":32,"verse":"We are from a family of twelve brothers; we are the sons of one father.
