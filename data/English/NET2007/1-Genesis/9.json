The animals will fear humans from this time forward.) Everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea are under your authority.

To say the animals have been given into the hands of humans means humans have been given authority over them.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"You may eat any moving thing that lives.

(tn The words “in it” are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons. sn You must not eat meat with its life…in it. Because of the carnage produced by the flood, people might conclude that life is cheap and therefore treat it lightly.

L. Dewar, “The Biblical Use of the Term ‘Blood,’” JTS 4 (1953): 204-8.) I will surely exact punishment, (tn The word “punishment” is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for clarification. The verb דָּרָשׁ (darash) means “to require, to seek, to ask for, to exact.” Here it means that God will exact punishment for the taking of a life. See R. Mawdsley, “Capital Punishment in Gen. 9:6,” CentBib 18 (1975): 20-25.) from (tn Heb “from the hand of,” which means “out of the hand of” or “out of the power of” and is nearly identical in sense to the preposition מִן (min) alone.) every living creature I will exact punishment. From each person (tn Heb “and from the hand of the man.” The article has a generic function, indicating the class, i. e., humankind.) I will exact punishment for the life of the individual (tn Heb “of the man.”) since the man was his relative. (tn Heb “from the hand of a man, his brother.” The point is that God will require the blood of someone who kills, since the person killed is a relative (“brother”) of the killer. The language reflects Noah’s situation (after the flood everyone would be part of Noah’s extended family), but also supports the concept of the brotherhood of humankind. According to the Genesis account the entire human race descended from Noah.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"“Whoever sheds human blood, (tn Heb “the blood of man.”) by other humans (tn Heb “by man,” a generic term here for other human beings.) must his blood be shed; for in God’s image (sn See the notes on the words “humankind” and “likeness” in Gen 1:26, as well as J.

Genesis 10 will explain that Canaan was the ancestor of the Canaanite tribes living in the promised land.) saw his father’s nakedness (tn Some would translate “had sexual relations with,” arguing that Ham committed a homosexual act with his drunken father for which he was cursed. However, the expression “see nakedness” usually refers to observation of another’s nakedness, not a sexual act (see Gen 42:9, 12 where “nakedness” is used metaphorically to convey the idea of “weakness” or “vulnerability”; Deut 23:14 where “nakedness” refers to excrement; Isa 47:3; Ezek 16:37; Lam 1:8). The following verse (v. 23) clearly indicates that visual observation, not a homosexual act, is in view here. In Lev 20:17 the expression “see nakedness” does appear to be a euphemism for sexual intercourse, but the context there, unlike that of Gen 9:22, clearly indicates that in that passage sexual contact is in view. The expression “see nakedness” does not in itself suggest a sexual connotation. Some relate Gen 9:22 to Lev 18:6–11, 15–19, where the expression “uncover [another’s] nakedness” (the Piel form of גָּלָה, galah) refers euphemistically to sexual intercourse. However, Gen 9:22 does not say Ham “uncovered” the nakedness of his father. According to the text, Noah uncovered himself; Ham merely saw his father naked. The point of the text is that Ham had no respect for his father. Rather than covering his father up, he told his brothers. Noah then gave an oracle that Ham’s descendants, who would be characterized by the same moral abandonment, would be cursed. Leviticus 18 describes that greater evil of the Canaanites (see vv. 24–28). sn Saw the nakedness. It is hard for modern people to appreciate why seeing another’s nakedness was such an abomination, because nakedness is so prevalent today. In the ancient world, especially in a patriarchal society, seeing another’s nakedness was a major offense. (See the account in Herodotus, Histories 1.8-13, where a general saw the nakedness of his master’s wife, and one of the two had to be put to death.) Besides, Ham was not a little boy wandering into his father’s bedroom; he was over a hundred years old by this time. For fuller discussion see A. P. Ross, “The Curse of Canaan,” BSac 137 (1980): 223-40.) and told his two brothers who were outside."},{"number":23,"verse":"Shem and Japheth took the garment (tn The word translated “garment” has the Hebrew definite article on it. The article may simply indicate that the garment is definite and vivid in the mind of the narrator, but it could refer instead to Noah’s garment. Did Ham bring it out when he told his brothers?) and placed it on their shoulders. Then they walked in backwards and covered up their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned (tn Heb “their faces [were turned] back.”) the other way so they did not see their father’s nakedness."},{"number":24,"verse":"When Noah awoke from his drunken stupor (tn Heb “his wine,” used here by metonymy for the drunken stupor it produced.) he learned (tn Heb “he knew.”) what his youngest son had done (tn The Hebrew verb עָשָׂה (’asah, “to do”) carries too general a sense to draw the conclusion that Ham had to have done more than look on his father’s nakedness and tell his brothers.) to him."},{"number":25,"verse":"So he said, “Cursed (sn For more on the curse, see H. C. Brichto, The Problem of “Curse” in the Hebrew Bible (JBLMS), and J. Scharbert, TDOT 1:405-18.) be Canaan! (sn Cursed be Canaan. The curse is pronounced on Canaan, not Ham. Noah sees a problem in Ham’s character, and on the basis of that he delivers a prophecy about the future descendants who will live in slavery to such things and then be controlled by others. (For more on the idea of slavery in general, see E. M. Yamauchi, “Slaves of God,” BETS 9 [1966]: 31-49). In a similar way Jacob pronounced oracles about his sons based on their revealed character (see Gen 49).) The lowest of slaves (tn Heb “a servant of servants” (עֶבֶד עֲבָדִים, ’eved ’avadim), an example of the superlative genitive. It means Canaan will become the most abject of slaves.) he will be to his brothers.”"},{"number":26,"verse":"He also said, “Worthy of praise is (tn Heb “blessed be.”) the LORD, the God of Shem!

(tn Heb “may God enlarge Japheth.” The words “territory and numbers” are supplied in the translation for clarity. sn There is a wordplay (paronomasia) on the name Japheth. The verb יַפְתְּ (yaft, “may he enlarge”) sounds like the name יֶפֶת (yefet, “Japheth”). The name itself suggested the idea. The blessing for Japheth extends beyond the son to the descendants. Their numbers and their territories will be enlarged, so much so that they will share in Shem’s territories. Again, in this oracle, Noah is looking beyond his immediate family to future generations.
