Num 15:1–10), thus completing the food “gift” to the Lord. It made atonement (see the note on Lev 1:4) along with the burnt offering (e. g., Lev 14:20) or alone as a sin offering for the poor (Lev 5:11–13).) to the LORD, his offering must consist of choice wheat flour, (tn The Hebrew term for “choice wheat flour” (סֹלֶת, selet) is often translated “fine flour” (cf. KJV, NAB, NIV, NCV), but it refers specifically to wheat as opposed to barley (B. A. Levine, Leviticus [JPSTC], 10). Moreover, the translation “flour” might be problematic, since the Hebrew term may designate the “grits” rather than the more finely ground “flour” (see J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:179 as opposed to Levine, 10, and J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 30).) and he must pour olive oil on it and put frankincense (sn This is not just any “incense” (קְטֹרֶת, qÿtoret; R. E. Averbeck, NIDOTTE 3:913-16), but specifically “frankincense” (לְבֹנָה, lÿvonah; R. E. Averbeck, NIDOTTE 2:756-57).) on it."},{"number":2,"verse":"Then he must bring it to the sons of Aaron, the priests, and the priest (tn Heb “and he”; the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity. The syntax is strange here and might suggest that it was the offerer who scooped out a handful of the grain offering for the memorial portion (G. J. Wenham, Leviticus [NICOT], 66), but based on v. 9 below it should be understood that it was the priest who performed this act (see, e. g., NRSV “After taking from it a handful of the choice flour and oil…the priest shall…”; see also J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:177, 181 and J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 30).) must scoop out from there a handful of its choice wheat flour and some of its olive oil in addition to all of its frankincense, and the priest must offer its memorial portion (sn The “memorial portion” (אַזְכָרָה, ’azkharah) was the part of the grain offering that was burnt on the altar (see the previous clause), as opposed to the remainder, which was normally consumed by the priests (v. 3; see the full regulations in Lev 6:14–23[7-16]). It was probably intended to call to mind (i. e., memorialize) before the Lord the reason for the presentation of the particular offering (see the remarks in R. E. Averbeck, NIDOTTE 1:335-39).) up in smoke on the altar — it is (tn The words “it is” have been supplied. See the notes on Lev 1:9 and 2:3. There is no text critical problem here, but the syntax suggests the same translation.) a gift of a soothing aroma to the LORD."},{"number":3,"verse":"The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and to his sons (tn Heb “…is to Aaron and to his sons.” The preposition “to” (לְ, lamed) indicates ownership. Cf. NAB, NASB, NIV and other English versions.) — it is (tn The words “it is” (הוּא, hu’) are not in the MT, but are supplied for the sake of translation into English. The Syriac also for translational reasons adds it between “most holy” and “from the gifts” (cf. 1:13, 17).) most holy (tn Heb “holy of holies”; KJV, NASB “a thing most holy.”) from the gifts of the LORD."},{"number":4,"verse":"(Processed Grain Offerings) “‘When you present an offering of grain baked in an oven, it must be made of (tn The insertion of the words “it must be made of” is justified by the context and the expressed words “it shall be made of” in vv. 7 and 8 below.) choice wheat flour baked into unleavened loaves (sn These “loaves” were either “ring-shaped” (HALOT 317 s. v. חַלָּה) or “perforated” (BDB 319 s. v. חַלָּה; cf. J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:184).) mixed with olive oil or (tn Heb “and.” Here the conjunction vav (ו) has an alternative sense (“or”).) unleavened wafers smeared (tn The Hebrew word מְשֻׁחִים (mÿshukhim) translated here as “smeared” is often translated “anointed” in other contexts. Cf. TEV “brushed with olive oil” (CEV similar).) with olive oil."},{"number":5,"verse":"If your offering is a grain offering made on the griddle, it must be choice wheat flour mixed with olive oil, unleavened."},{"number":6,"verse":"Crumble it in pieces (tn There is no vav (ו, “and”) in the MT at the beginning of v. 6 and the verb is pointed as an infinite absolute. The present translation has rendered it as an imperative (see GKC 346 §113. bb) and, therefore, the same for the following vav consecutive perfect verb (cf. NIV “Crumble it and pour oil on it”; cf. also NRSV, NEB, NLT, and J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:185, but note the objections to this rendering in J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 26). The LXX seems to suggest adding a vav (“and”) and pointing the verb as a consecutive perfect, which yields “and you shall break it in pieces” (cf. the BHS textual note; Hartley, 26, prefers the LXX rendering).) and pour olive oil on it — it is a grain offering."},{"number":7,"verse":"If your offering is a grain offering made in a pan, (tn Heb “a grain offering of a pan”; cf. KJV “fryingpan”; NAB “pot”; CEV “pan with a lid on it.”) it must be made of choice wheat flour deep fried in olive oil. (sn Lev 7:9 makes it clear that one cooked “on” a griddle but “in” a pan. This suggests that the oil in the pan served for deep fat frying, hence the translation “deep fried in olive oil” (see, e. g., J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:185); cf. also NAB.)"},{"number":8,"verse":"“‘You must bring the grain offering that must be made from these to the LORD. Present it to the priest, (tc There are several person, gender, and voice verb problems in this verse. First, the MT has “And you shall bring the grain offering,” but the LXX and Qumran have “he” rather than “you” (J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:185). Second, the MT has “which shall be made” (i. e., the 3rd person masculine Niphal passive verb which, in fact, does not agree with its feminine subject, מִנְחָה, minkhah, “grain offering”), while the LXX has “which he shall make” (3rd person Qal), thus agreeing with the LXX 3rd person verb at the beginning of the verse (see above). Third, the MT has a 3rd person vav consecutive verb “and he shall present it to the priest,” which agrees with the LXX but is not internally consistent with the 2nd person verb at the beginning of the verse in the MT. The BHS editors conjecture that the latter might be repointed to an imperative verb yielding “present it to the priest.” This would require no change of consonants and corresponds to the person of the first verb in the MT. This solution has been tentatively accepted here (cf. also J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 26-27), even though it neither resolves the gender problem of the second verb nor fits the general grammatical pattern of the chapter in the MT.) and he will bring it to the altar."},{"number":9,"verse":"Then the priest must take up (tn The Hebrew verb הֵרִים (herim, “to take up”; cf. NAB “lift”) is commonly used for setting aside portions of an offering (see, e. g., Lev 4:8–10 and R. E. Averbeck, NIDOTTE 4:335-36). A number of English versions employ the more normal English idiom “take out” here (e. g., NIV, NCV); cf. NRSV “remove.”) from the grain offering its memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar — it is (tn The words “it is” (הוּא, hu’) both here and in vv. 10 and 16 are not in the MT, but are assumed.

KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV), but “yeast” is more commonly used today.) for you must not offer up in smoke any yeast or honey as a gift to the LORD. (tc A few Hebrew mss, Smr, LXX, and Tg. Ps.-J. have the verb “present” rather than “offer up in smoke,” but the MT is clearly correct. One could indeed present leavened and honey sweetened offerings as first fruit offerings, which were not burned on the altar (see v. 12 and the note there), but they could not be offered up in fire on the altar. Cf. the TEV’s ambiguous “you must never use yeast or honey in food offered to the Lord.”tn Heb “for all leaven and all honey you must not offer up in smoke from it a gift to the Lord.”)"},{"number":12,"verse":"You can present them to the LORD as an offering of first fruit, (sn The “first fruit” referred to here was given to the priests as a prebend for their service to the Lord, not offered on the altar (Num 18:12).) but they must not go up to the altar for a soothing aroma."},{"number":13,"verse":"Moreover, you must season every one of your grain offerings with salt; you must not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be missing from your grain offering (tn Heb “from upon your grain offering.”) — on every one of your grain offerings you must present salt."},{"number":14,"verse":"“‘If you present a grain offering of first ripe grain to the LORD, you must present your grain offering of first ripe grain as soft kernels roasted in fire — crushed bits of fresh grain. (tn The translation of this whole section of the clause is difficult. Theoretically, it could describe one, two, or three different ways of preparing first ripe grain offerings (J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 27). The translation here takes it as a description of only one kind of prepared grain. This is suggested by the fact that v. 16 uses only one term “crushed bits” (גֶּרֶשׂ, geres) to refer back to the grain as it is prepared in v. 14 (a more technical translation is “groats”; see J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:178, 194). Cf. NAB “fresh grits of new ears of grain”; NRSV “coarse new grain from fresh ears.”)"},{"number":15,"verse":"And you must put olive oil on it and set frankincense on it — it is a grain offering."},{"number":16,"verse":"Then the priest must offer its memorial portion up in smoke — some of its crushed bits, some of its olive oil, in addition to all of its frankincense — it is (tn See the note on “it is” in 2:9b.) a gift to the LORD."}]}
