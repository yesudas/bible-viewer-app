Regarding the various articles of clothing see J. E. Hartley, Leviticus (WBC), 111-12 and esp. J. Milgrom, Leviticus (AB), 1:501-13.) put the tunic (sn The term “tunic” refers to a shirt-like garment worn next to the skin and, therefore, put on first (cf. Exod 28:4, 39–40; 29:5, 8; 39:27). Traditionally this has been translated “coat” (so KJV, ASV), but that English word designates an outer garment.) on Aaron, (tn Heb “on him”; the referent (Aaron) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) wrapped the sash around him, (tn Heb “girded him with the sash” (so NASB); NCV “tied the cloth belt around him.”sn The sash fastened the tunic around the waist (Exod 28:4, 39; 29:9; 39:29).) and clothed him with the robe. (sn The robe was a long shirt-like over-garment that reached down below the knees. Its hem was embroidered with pomegranates and golden bells around the bottom (Exod 28:4, 31–35; 29:5; 39:22–26).) Next he put the ephod on him (sn The ephod was an apron like garment suspended from shoulder straps. It draped over the robe and extended from the chest down to the thighs (Exod 28:4, 6–14, 25–28; 29:5; 39:2–7).) and placed on him (tn Heb “girded him with.”) the decorated band of the ephod, and fastened the ephod closely to him with the band. (sn The decorated band of the ephod served as a sort of belt around Aaron’s body that would hold the ephod closely to him rather than allowing it to hang loosely across his front (Exod 28:8, 27; 29:5; 39:5, 20).)"},{"number":8,"verse":"He then set the breastpiece (sn The breastpiece was made of the same material as the ephod and was attached to it by means of gold rings and chains on its four corners (Exod 28:15–30; 29:5; 39:8–21). It had twelve stones attached to it (representing the twelve tribes of Israel), and a pocket in which the Urim and Thummim were kept (see following).) on him and put the Urim and Thummim (sn The Urim and Thummim were two small objects used in the casting of lots to discern the will of God (see Exod 28:30; Num 27:21; Deut 33:8; 1 Sam 14:41 in the LXX and 28:6; Ezra 2:63 and Neh 7:65). It appears that by casting them one could obtain a yes or no answer, or no answer at all (1 Sam 28:6; J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 111-12). See the extensive discussion in J. Milgrom, Leviticus (AB), 1:507-11.) into the breastpiece."},{"number":9,"verse":"Finally, he set the turban (tn Although usually thought to be a “turban” (and so translated by the majority of English versions) this object might be only a “turban-like headband” wound around the forehead area (HALOT 624 s. v. מִצְנֶפֶת). sn The turban consisted of wound-up linen (cf. Exod 28:4, 37, 39; 29:6; 39:31; Lev 16:4).) on his head and attached the gold plate, the holy diadem, (sn The gold plate was attached as a holy diadem to the front of the turban by means of a blue cord, and had written on it “Holy to the Lord” (Exod 28:36–37; 39:30–31). This was a particularly important article of high priestly clothing in that it served as the main emblem indicating Aaron’s acceptable representation of Israel before the Lord (Exod 28:38).) to the front of the turban just as the LORD had commanded Moses."},{"number":10,"verse":"(Anointing the Tabernacle and Aaron, and Clothing Aaron’s Sons) Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them. (sn The expression “and consecrated it” refers to the effect of the anointing earlier in the verse (cf. “to consecrate them/him” in vv. 11 and 12). “To consecrate” means “to make holy” or “make sacred”; i. e., put something into the category of holy/sacred as opposed to common/profane (see Lev 10:10 below). Thus, the person or thing consecrated is put into the realm of God’s holy things.)"},{"number":11,"verse":"Next he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and so anointed the altar, all its vessels, and the wash basin and its stand to consecrate them."},{"number":12,"verse":"He then poured some of the anointing oil on the head of Aaron and anointed him to consecrate him."},{"number":13,"verse":"Moses also brought forward Aaron’s sons, clothed them with tunics, wrapped sashes around them, (tc The MT has here “sash” (singular), but the context is clearly plural and Smr has it in the plural. tn Heb “girded them with sashes” (so NAB, NASB); NRSV “fastened sashes around them.”) and wrapped headbands on them (tn Heb “wrapped headdresses to them”; cf. KJV “bonnets”; NASB, TEV “caps”; NIV, NCV “headbands”; NAB, NLT “turbans.”sn Notice that the priestly garments of Aaron’s sons are quite limited compared to those of Aaron himself, the high priest (cf. vv. 7–9 above). The terms for “tunic” and “sash” are the same but not the headgear (cf. Exod 28:40; 29:8–9; 39:27–29).) just as the LORD had commanded Moses."},{"number":14,"verse":"(Consecration Offerings) Then he brought near the sin offering bull (sn See Lev 4:3–12 above for the sin offering of the priests. In this case, however, the blood manipulation is different because Moses, not Aaron (and his sons), is functioning as the priest. On the one hand, Aaron and his sons are, in a sense, treated as if they were commoners so that the blood manipulation took place at the burnt offering altar in the court of the tabernacle (see v. 15 below), not at the incense altar inside the tabernacle tent itself (contrast Lev 4:5–7 and compare 4:30). On the other hand, since it was a sin offering for the priests, therefore, the priests themselves could not eat its flesh (Lev 4:11–12; 6:30 [23 HT]), which was the normal priestly practice for sin offerings of commoners (Lev 6:26[19], 29[22]).) and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the sin offering bull,"},{"number":15,"verse":"and he slaughtered it. (sn Contrary to some English versions (e. g., NAB, NASB, NIV, NLT), Aaron (not Moses) most likely slaughtered the bull, possibly with the help of his sons, although the verb is singular, not plural. Moses then performed the ritual procedures that involved direct contact with the altar. Compare the pattern in Lev 1:5–9, where the offerer does the slaughtering and the priests perform the procedures that involve direct contact with the altar. In Lev 8 Moses is functioning as the priest in order to consecrate the priesthood. The explicit reintroduction of the name of Moses as the subject of the next verb seems to reinforce this understanding of the passage (cf. also vv. 19 and 23 below).) Moses then took the blood and put it all around on the horns of the altar with his finger and decontaminated the altar, (tn The verb is the Piel of חָטָא (khata’, “to sin”) and means “to de-sin” the altar. This verse is important for confirming the main purpose of the sin offering, which was to decontaminate the tabernacle and its furniture from any impurities. See the note on Lev 4:3.) and he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and so consecrated it to make atonement on it. (tn Similar to v. 10 above, “and consecrated it” refers to the effect of the blood manipulation earlier in the verse. The goal here was to consecrate the altar in order that it might become a place on which it would be appropriate “to make atonement” before the Lord.)"},{"number":16,"verse":"Then he (tn Again, Aaron probably performed the slaughter and collected the fat parts (v. 16a), but Moses presented it all on the altar (v. 16b; cf. the note on v. 15 above).) took all the fat on the entrails, the protruding lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, (sn See Lev 3:3–4 for the terminology of fat and kidneys here.) and Moses offered it all up in smoke on the altar, (tn Heb “toward the altar” (see the note on Lev 1:9).)"},{"number":17,"verse":"but the rest of the bull — its hide, its flesh, and its dung — he completely burned up (tn Heb “he burned with fire,” an expression which is sometimes redundant in English, but here means “burned up,” “burned up entirely.”) outside the camp just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

See the similar shifts from Moses to Aaron as the subject of the action above (vv. 15, 16, 19, 20, 23), and esp. the note on Lev 8:15. In the present translation this is rendered as an adjectival clause (“who waved”) to indicate that the referent is not Moses but Aaron and his sons. Cf. CEV “who lifted it up”; NAB “whom he had wave” (with “he” referring to Moses here).) them as a wave offering before the LORD.

Lev 7:37 and the note there) is closely related to the expression “he shall fill (Piel מִלֵּא, mille’) your hands” in this verse. Some derive the terminology from the procedure in Lev 8:27–28, but the term for “hands” there is actually “palms.” It seems more likely that it derives from the notion of putting the priestly responsibilities (or possibly its associated prebends) under their control (i. e., “filling their hands” with authority; see J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:538-39).
