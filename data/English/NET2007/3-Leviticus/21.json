Lev 19:28 above and the literature cited there).) no priest (tn Heb “no one,” but “priest” has been used in the translation to clarify that these restrictions are limited to the priests, not to the Israelites in general (note the introductory formula, “say to the priests, the sons of Aaron”).) is to defile himself among his people, (tc The MT has “in his peoples,” but Smr, LXX, Syriac, Targum, and Tg.

(tn Heb “He shall not defile himself a husband in his peoples, to profane himself.” The meaning of the line is disputed, but it appears to prohibit a priest from burying any relative by marriage (as opposed to the blood relatives of vv. 2–3), including his wife (compare B. A. Levine, Leviticus [JPSTC], 142-43 with J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 343, 348).)"},{"number":5,"verse":"Priests (tn Heb “they”; the referent (priests, see the beginning of v. 1) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) must not have a bald spot shaved on their head, they must not shave the corner of their beard, and they must not cut slashes in their body. (tn Heb “and in their body they shall not [cut] slash[es]” (cf. Lev 19:28). The context connects these sorts of mutilations with mourning rites (cf. Lev 19:27–28 above).)"},{"number":6,"verse":"“‘They must be holy to their God, and they must not profane (sn Regarding “profane,” see the note on Lev 10:10 above.) the name of their God, because they are the ones who present the LORD’s gifts, (sn Regarding the Hebrew term for “gifts,” see the note on Lev 1:9 above (cf. also 3:11 and 16 in combination with the word for “food” that follows in the next phrase here).) the food of their God. Therefore they must be holy. (tc Smr and all early versions have the plural adjective “holy” rather than the MT singular noun “holiness.”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"They must not take a wife defiled by prostitution, (tn Heb “A wife harlot and profaned they shall not take.” The structure of the verse (e. g., “wife” at the beginning of the two main clauses) suggests that “harlot and profaned” constitutes a hendiadys, meaning “a wife defiled by harlotry” (see the explanation in B. A. Levine, Leviticus [JPSTC], 143, as opposed to that in J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 343, 348; cf. v. 14 below). Cf. NASB “a woman who is profaned by harlotry.”) nor are they to take a wife divorced from her husband, (sn For a helpful discussion of divorce in general and as it relates to this passage see B. A. Levine, Leviticus (JPSTC), 143-44.) for the priest (tn Heb “he”; the referent (the priest) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) is holy to his God.

He must be holy to you because I, the LORD who sanctifies you all, (tn The three previous second person references in this verse are all singular, but this reference is plural. By adding “all” this grammatical distinction is preserved in the translation.) am holy."},{"number":9,"verse":"If a daughter of a priest profanes herself by engaging in prostitution, she is profaning her father.

(tn Regarding these signs of mourning see the note on Lev 10:6. His head had been anointed (v. 10a) so it must not be unkempt (v. 10b), and his garments were special priestly garments (v. 10a) so he must not tear them (v. 10b). In the translation “garments” has been employed rather than “clothes” to suggest that the special priestly garments are referred to here; cf. NRSV “nor tear his vestments.”)"},{"number":11,"verse":"He must not go where there is any dead person; (tc Although the MT has “persons” (plural), the LXX and Syriac have the singular “person” corresponding to the singular adjectival participle “dead” (cf. also Num 6:6).) he must not defile himself even for his father and his mother."},{"number":12,"verse":"He must not go out from the sanctuary and must not profane (sn Regarding “profane,” see the note on Lev 10:10 above.) the sanctuary of his God, because the dedication of the anointing oil of his God is on him.

See HALOT 386 s. v. יָד and 1184 s. v. רֶגֶל respectively (cf. the NJPS translation). In this context, these terms probably apply to any part of the limb that was broken, including hand and the foot. B. A. Levine (Leviticus [JPSTC], 146) points out that such injuries often did not heal properly in antiquity because they were not properly set and, therefore, remained a “physical flaw” permanently.)"},{"number":20,"verse":"or a hunchback, or a dwarf, (tn Heb “thin”; cf.

Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 342, 344).) or one with a spot in his eye, (tn The term rendered “spot” derives from a root meaning “mixed” or “confused” (cf. NAB “walleyed”).
