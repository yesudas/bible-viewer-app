It appears to be a diminutive play on words with אֵל (’el, “god, God”) and, perhaps at the same time, recalls a common Semitic word for “worthless, weak, powerless, nothingness.” Snaith suggests a rendering of “worthless godlings.”) so you must not set up for yourselves a carved image or a pillar, and you must not place a sculpted stone in your land to bow down before (tn Heb “on.” The “sculpted stone” appears to be some sort of stone with images carved into (see B.
