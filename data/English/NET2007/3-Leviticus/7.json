Lev 8:33) here anticipates Lev 8. It is a kind of peace offering, as the regulations in Lev 8:22–32 will show (cf. Exod 29:19–34). In the context of the ordination ritual for the priests it fits into the sequence of offerings as a peace offering would: sin offering (Lev 8:14–17), burnt and grain offering (Lev 8:18–21), and finally peace (i. e., ordination) offering (Lev 8:22–32). Moreover, in this case, Moses received the breast of the ordination offering as his due since he was the presiding priest over the sacrificial procedures (Lev 8:29; cf. Lev 7:30–31), while Aaron and his sons ate the portions that would have been consumed by the common worshipers in a regular peace offering procedure (Exod 29:31–34; cf. Lev 7:15–18).
