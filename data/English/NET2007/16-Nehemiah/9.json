But apparently something has dropped out of the text. This phrase occurs elsewhere in the OT as a description of the Lord (see Ps 41:13; 106:48), and it seems best to understand it here in that light. The LXX adds “And Ezra said” at the beginning of v. 6 as a transition: “And Ezra said, ‘You alone are the LORD.” Without this addition (which is not included by most modern English translations) the speakers of vv. 9:5b–10:1 continue to be the Levites of v. 5a.) May your glorious name (tn Heb “the name of your glory.”) be blessed; may it be lifted up above all blessing and praise."},{"number":6,"verse":"You alone are the LORD.
