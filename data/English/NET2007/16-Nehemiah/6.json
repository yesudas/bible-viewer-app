Let’s set up a time to meet together at Kephirim (tn It is not entirely clear whether the Hebrew word כְּפִירִים (kÿfirim) is a place-name not mentioned elsewhere in the OT (as indicated in the present translation; so also NAB, NASB) or whether it means “in [one of] the villages” (so, e. g., NIV, NRSV, NLT; see BDB 499 s. v.; HALOT 493 s. v.). The LXX and Vulgate understand it in the latter sense. Some scholars connect this term with the identically spelled word כּפירים (“lions”) as a figurative description of princes or warriors (e. g., Pss 34:11; 35:17; 58:7; Jer 2:15; Ezek 32:2, 13; Nah 2:14; see HALOT 493 s. v.): “let us meet together with the leaders in the plain of Ono.”) in the plain of Ono.” Now they intended to do me harm."},{"number":3,"verse":"So I sent messengers to them saying, “I am engaged in (tn Heb “[am] doing.”) an important work, and I am unable to come down.

It will surely be at night that they will come to kill you.”"},{"number":11,"verse":"But I replied, “Should a man like me run away? Would someone like me flee to the temple in order to save his life?
