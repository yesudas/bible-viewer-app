The initial vav (ו) on original וְיַיִן probably dropped out due to haplograpy or orthographic confusion with the two yods (י) which follow. The final vav on לְפָנָיו in the MT was probably added due to dittography with the vav on the immediately following word.) I took the wine and gave it to the king. Previously (tc The translation reads לְפָנֵים (lÿfanim, “formerly”) rather than לְפָנָיו (lÿfanayv, “to his face”) of the MT. The MT seems to suggest that Nehemiah was not sad before the king, which is contrary to what follows.) I had not been depressed (tn Or “showed him a sullen face.” See HALOT 1251 s. v. רַע, רָע 9.) in the king’s presence. (tn This expression is either to be inferred from the context, or perhaps one should read לְפָנָיו (lÿfanayv, “before him”; cf. the MT) in addition to לְפָנִים (lÿfanim, “formerly”). See preceding note on the word “previously.”)"},{"number":2,"verse":"So the king said to me, “Why do you appear to be depressed when you aren’t sick? What can this be other than sadness of heart?” This made me very fearful."},{"number":3,"verse":"I replied to the king, “O king, live forever! Why would I not appear dejected when the city with the graves of my ancestors (tn Heb “fathers” (also in v. 5).) lies desolate and its gates destroyed (tn Heb “devoured” or “eaten” (so also in Neh 2:13).) by fire?”"},{"number":4,"verse":"The king responded, (tn Heb “said to me.”) “What is it you are seeking?” Then I quickly prayed to the God of heaven"},{"number":5,"verse":"and said to the king, “If the king is so inclined (tn Heb “If upon the king it is good.” So also in v. 7.) and if your servant has found favor in your sight, dispatch me to Judah, to the city with the graves of my ancestors, so that I can rebuild it.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"Then the king, with his consort (tn Or “queen,” so most English versions (cf. HALOT 1415 s. v. שֵׁגַל); TEV “empress.”) sitting beside him, replied, “How long would your trip take, and when would you return?” Since the king was amenable to dispatching me, (tn Heb “It was good before the king and he sent me.”) I gave him a time."},{"number":7,"verse":"I said to the king, “If the king is so inclined, let him give me letters for the governors of Trans-Euphrates (tn Heb “across the river,” here and often elsewhere in the Book of Nehemiah.) that will enable me to travel safely until I reach Judah,"},{"number":8,"verse":"and a letter for Asaph the keeper of the king’s nature preserve, (tn Or “forest.” So HALOT 963 s. v. פַּרְדֵּס 2.) so that he will give me timber for beams for the gates of the fortress adjacent to the temple and for the city wall (tc One medieval Hebrew MS, the Syriac Peshitta, Vulgate, and the Arabic read here the plural וּלְחוֹמוֹת (ulÿkhomot, “walls”) against the singular וּלְחוֹמַת (ulÿkhomat) in the MT. The plural holem vav (וֹ) might have dropped out due to dittography or the plural form might have been written defectively.) and for the house to which I go.” So the king granted me these requests, (tn The Hebrew text does not include the expression “these requests,” but it is implied.) for the good hand of my God was on me."},{"number":9,"verse":"Then I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, and I presented to them the letters from the king.

We his servants will start the rebuilding. (tn Heb “will arise and build.” The idiom “arise and…” means to begin the action described by the second verb.)
