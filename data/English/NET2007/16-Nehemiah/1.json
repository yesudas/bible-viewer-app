According to the Talmud, “Ezra wrote his book” (b. Bava Batra 15a). The Gemara then asks and answers, “And who finished it? Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.” Accordingly, the two are joined in the Leningrad Codex (ca. A. D. 1008), the manuscript upon which modern printed editions of the Hebrew Bible (e. g., BHK and BHS) are based.) These are the words of Nehemiah (sn The name Nehemiah in Hebrew (נְחֶמְיָה, nÿkhemyah) means “the LORD comforts.”) son of Hacaliah: It so happened that in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year, (tn That is, the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes’ reign (cf. 2:1).)

The expression “burned with fire” is redundant in contemporary English; the translation uses “burned down” for stylistic reasons.)"},{"number":4,"verse":"When I heard these things I sat down abruptly, (tn Heb “sat down.” Context suggests that this was a rather sudden action, resulting from the emotional shock of the unpleasant news, so “abruptly” has been supplied in the present translation.) crying and mourning for several days. I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven."},{"number":5,"verse":"Then I said, “Please, O LORD God of heaven, great and awesome God, who keeps his loving covenant (tn Heb “the covenant and loyal love.” The phrase is a hendiadys: the first noun retains its full nominal sense, while the second noun functions adjectivally (“loyal love” = loving).
