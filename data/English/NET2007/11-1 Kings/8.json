The parallel text in 2 Chr 6:22 begins with “and if,” rather than the accusative sign. In this case “forgive” must be taken with what precedes, and v. 31 must be taken as the protasis (“if” clause) of a conditional sentence, with v. 32 being the apodosis (“then” clause) that completes the sentence. sn Be willing to forgive the accused if the accusation is false. At first it appears that Solomon is asking God to forgive the guilty party.
