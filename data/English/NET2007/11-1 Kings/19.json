He left his servant there,"},{"number":4,"verse":"while he went a day’s journey into the desert. He went and sat down under a shrub (tn Or “broom tree” (also in v. 5).) and asked the LORD to take his life: (tn Heb “and asked with respect to his life to die.”) “I’ve had enough! Now, O LORD, take my life. After all, I’m no better than my ancestors.” (tn Heb “fathers.”)"},{"number":5,"verse":"He stretched out (tn Or “lay down.”) and fell asleep under the shrub. All of a sudden an angelic messenger (tn Heb “Look, a messenger.”) touched him and said, “Get up and eat.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"He looked and right there by his head was a cake baking on hot coals and a jug of water. He ate and drank and then slept some more. (tn Heb “and again lay down”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"The LORD’s angelic messenger came back again, touched him, and said, “Get up and eat, for otherwise you won’t be able to make the journey.” (tn Heb “for the journey is too great for you.”)"},{"number":8,"verse":"So he got up and ate and drank. That meal gave him the strength to travel forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God."},{"number":9,"verse":"He went into a cave there and spent the night. All of a sudden the LORD spoke to him, “Why are you here, Elijah?”"},{"number":10,"verse":"He answered, “I have been absolutely loyal (tn Or “very zealous.” The infinitive absolute preceding the finite verb emphasizes the degree of his zeal and allegiance.) to the LORD, the sovereign God, (tn Traditionally, “the God of hosts.”) even though the Israelites have abandoned the agreement they made with you, (tn Heb “abandoned your covenant.”) torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left and now they want to take my life.” (tn Heb “and they are seeking my life to take it.”)"},{"number":11,"verse":"The LORD (tn Heb “he”; the referent (the Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD. Look, the LORD is ready to pass by.” A very powerful wind went before the LORD, digging into the mountain and causing landslides, (tn Heb “tearing away the mountains and breaking the cliffs” (or perhaps, “breaking the stones”).) but the LORD was not in the wind. After the windstorm there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake."},{"number":12,"verse":"After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a soft whisper. (tn Heb “a voice, calm, soft.”)"},{"number":13,"verse":"When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his robe and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. All of a sudden (tn Heb “look.”) a voice asked him, “Why are you here, Elijah?”"},{"number":14,"verse":"He answered, “I have been absolutely loyal (tn Or “very zealous.” The infinitive absolute preceding the finite verb emphasizes the degree of his zeal and allegiance.) to the LORD, the sovereign God, (tn Traditionally, “the God of hosts.”) even though the Israelites have abandoned the agreement they made with you, (tn Heb “abandoned your covenant.”) torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword.

Go and anoint Hazael king over Syria."},{"number":16,"verse":"You must anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to take your place as prophet."},{"number":17,"verse":"Jehu will kill anyone who escapes Hazael’s sword, and Elisha will kill anyone who escapes Jehu’s sword."},{"number":18,"verse":"I still have left in Israel seven thousand followers who have not bowed their knees to Baal or kissed the images of him.” (tn Heb “I have kept in Israel seven thousand, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and all the mouths that have not kissed him.”)"},{"number":19,"verse":"Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen; he was near the twelfth pair. Elijah passed by him and threw his robe over him."},{"number":20,"verse":"He left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, then I will follow you.” Elijah (tn Heb “he”; the referent (Elijah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) said to him, “Go back!

He cooked the meat over a fire that he made by burning the harness and yoke. (tn Heb “and with the equipment of the oxen he cooked them, the flesh.”) He gave the people meat and they ate. Then he got up and followed Elijah and became his assistant."}]}
