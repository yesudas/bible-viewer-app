(sn In the same way he had appeared to him at Gibeon. See 1 Kgs 3:5.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"The LORD said to him, “I have answered (tn Heb “I have heard.”) your prayer and your request for help that you made to me. I have consecrated this temple you built by making it my permanent home; (tn Heb “by placing my name there perpetually” (or perhaps, “forever”).) I will be constantly present there. (tn Heb “and my eyes and my heart will be there all the days.”)"},{"number":4,"verse":"You must serve me with integrity and sincerity, just as your father David did. Do everything I commanded and obey my rules and regulations. (tn Heb “As for you, if you walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, by doing all which I commanded you, [and] you keep my rules and my regulations.” Verse 4 is actually a lengthy protasis (“if” section) of a conditional sentence, the apodosis (“then” section) of which appears in v. 5.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"Then I will allow your dynasty to rule over Israel permanently, (tn Heb “I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever.”) just as I promised your father David, ‘You will not fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’ (tn Heb “there will not be cut off from you a man from upon the throne of Israel.”)"},{"number":6,"verse":"“But if you or your sons ever turn away from me, fail to obey the regulations and rules I instructed you to keep, (tn Heb “which I placed before you.”) and decide to serve and worship other gods, (tn Heb “and walk and serve other gods and bow down to them.”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"then I will remove Israel from the land (tn Heb “I will cut off Israel from upon the surface of the land.”) I have given them, I will abandon this temple I have consecrated with my presence, (tn Heb “and the temple which I consecrated for my name I will send away from before my face.”sn Instead of “I will send away,” the parallel text in 2 Chr 7:20 has “I will throw away.” The two verbs sound very similar in Hebrew, so the discrepancy is likely due to an oral transmissional error.) and Israel will be mocked and ridiculed (tn Heb “will become a proverb and a taunt,” that is, a proverbial example of destruction and an object of reproach.) among all the nations."},{"number":8,"verse":"This temple will become a heap of ruins; (tn Heb “and this house will be high [or elevated].” The statement makes little sense in this context, which predicts the desolation that judgment will bring. Some treat the clause as concessive, “Even though this temple is lofty [now].” Others, following the lead of several ancient versions, emend the text to, “this temple will become a heap of ruins.”) everyone who passes by it will be shocked and will hiss out their scorn, (tn Heb “hiss,” or perhaps “whistle.” This refers to a derisive sound one would make when taunting an object of ridicule.) saying, ‘Why did the LORD do this to this land and this temple?’"},{"number":9,"verse":"Others will then answer, (tn Heb “and they will say.”) ‘Because they abandoned the LORD their God, who led their ancestors (tn Heb “fathers.”) out of Egypt. They embraced other gods whom they worshiped and served. (tn Heb “and they took hold of other gods and bowed down to them and served them.”) That is why the LORD has brought all this disaster down on them.’”"},{"number":10,"verse":"(Foreign Affairs and Building Projects) After twenty years, during which Solomon built the LORD’s temple and the royal palace, (tn Heb “the two houses, the house of the Lord and the house of the king.”)"},{"number":11,"verse":"King Solomon gave King Hiram of Tyre (map For location see Map1-A2; Map2-G2; Map4-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.) twenty cities in the region of Galilee, because Hiram had supplied Solomon with cedars, evergreens, and all the gold he wanted."},{"number":12,"verse":"When Hiram went out from Tyre to inspect the cities Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.

(tn Heb “he called them the land of Cabul to this day.” The significance of the name is unclear, though it appears to be disparaging. The name may be derived from a root, attested in Akkadian and Arabic, meaning “bound” or “restricted.” Some propose a wordplay, pointing out that the name “Cabul” sounds like a Hebrew phrase meaning, “like not,” or “as good as nothing.”)"},{"number":14,"verse":"Hiram had sent to the king one hundred twenty talents (tn The Hebrew term כִּכָּר (kikkar, “circle”) refers generally to something that is round. When used of metals it can refer to a disk-shaped weight made of the metal or to a standard unit of weight, generally regarded as a talent.

The work crews referred to here must be different than the temporary crews described in 5:13–16.) the Israelites served as his soldiers, attendants, officers, charioteers, and commanders of his chariot forces. (tn Heb “officers of his chariots and his horses.”)"},{"number":23,"verse":"These men were also in charge of Solomon’s work projects; there were a total of 550 men who supervised the workers. (tn Heb “these [were] the officials of the governors who were over the work belonging to Solomon, five hundred fifty, the ones ruling over the people, the ones doing the work.”)"},{"number":24,"verse":"Solomon built the terrace as soon as Pharaoh’s daughter moved up from the city of David (sn The phrase city of David refers here to the fortress of Zion in Jerusalem, not to Bethlehem.
