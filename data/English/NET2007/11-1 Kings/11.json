(tn Heb “you must not go into them, and they must not go into you.”) If you do, they will surely shift your allegiance to their gods.” (tn Heb “Surely they will bend your heart after their gods.” The words “if you do” are supplied in the translation for clarification.) But Solomon was irresistibly attracted to them. (tn Heb “Solomon clung to them for love.” The pronominal suffix, translated “them,” is masculine here, even though it appears the foreign women are in view. Perhaps this is due to attraction to the masculine forms used of the nations earlier in the verse.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"He had 700 royal wives (tn Heb “wives, princesses.”) and 300 concubines; (sn Concubines were slave women in ancient Near Eastern societies who were the legal property of their master, but who could have legitimate sexual relations with their master. A concubine’s status was more elevated than a mere servant, but she was not free and did not have the legal rights of a free wife. The children of a concubine could, in some instances, become equal heirs with the children of the free wife. The usage in the present passage suggests that after the period of the Judges concubines may have become more of a royal prerogative (cf. also 2 Sam 21:10–14).) his wives had a powerful influence over him. (tn Heb “his wives bent his heart.”)"},{"number":4,"verse":"When Solomon became old, his wives shifted his allegiance to (tn Heb “bent his heart after.”) other gods; he was not wholeheartedly devoted to the LORD his God, as his father David had been. (tn Heb “his heart was not complete with the Lord his God, like the heart of David his father.”)"},{"number":5,"verse":"Solomon worshiped (tn Heb “walked after.”) the Sidonian goddess Astarte and the detestable Ammonite god Milcom. (tn Heb “Milcom, the detestable thing of the Ammonites.”)"},{"number":6,"verse":"Solomon did evil in the LORD’s sight; (tn Heb “in the eyes of the Lord.”) he did not remain loyal to (tn The idiomatic statement reads in Hebrew, “he did not fill up after.”) the LORD, like his father David had."},{"number":7,"verse":"Furthermore, (tn Heb “then.”) on the hill east of Jerusalem (sn The hill east of Jerusalem refers to the Mount of Olives. map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) Solomon built a high place (sn A high place. The “high places” were places of worship that were naturally or artificially elevated (see 1 Kgs 3:2).) for the detestable Moabite god Chemosh (tn Heb “Chemosh, the detestable thing of Moab.”) and for the detestable Ammonite god Milcom. (tc The MT reads “Molech,” but Milcom must be intended (see vv. 5, 33).)"},{"number":8,"verse":"He built high places for all his foreign wives so they could burn incense and make sacrifices to their gods. (tn Heb “and the same thing he did for all his foreign wives, [who] were burning incense and sacrificing to their gods.”)"},{"number":9,"verse":"The LORD was angry with Solomon because he had shifted his allegiance (tn Heb “bent his heart.”) away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him on two occasions (sn These two occasions are mentioned in 1 Kgs 3:5 and 9:2.)"},{"number":10,"verse":"and had warned him about this very thing, so that he would not follow other gods.

I will tear it away from your son’s hand instead."},{"number":13,"verse":"But I will not tear away the entire kingdom; I will leave (tn Heb “give.”) your son one tribe for my servant David’s sake and for the sake of my chosen city Jerusalem.”"},{"number":14,"verse":"The LORD brought (tn Or “raised up.”) against Solomon an enemy, Hadad the Edomite, a descendant of the Edomite king."},{"number":15,"verse":"During David’s campaign against Edom, (tn Heb “when David was [fighting (?)] with Edom.”) Joab, the commander of the army, while on a mission to bury the dead, killed every male in Edom."},{"number":16,"verse":"For six months Joab and the entire Israelite army (tn Heb “and all Israel.”) stayed there until they had exterminated every male in Edom. (tn Heb “until he had cut off every male in Edom.”)"},{"number":17,"verse":"Hadad, (tn The MT reads “Adad,” an alternate form of the name Hadad.) who was only a small boy at the time, escaped with some of his father’s Edomite servants and headed for Egypt.

(tn Heb “and he gave to him a wife, the sister of his wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.”)"},{"number":20,"verse":"Tahpenes’ sister gave birth to his son, (tn Heb “bore him Genubath his son.”) named Genubath. Tahpenes raised (tc The Hebrew text reads וַתִּגְמְלֵהוּ (vattigmÿlehu, “weaned him”) but a slight alteration of the consonantal text yields וַתִּגְדְלֵהוּ (vattigdÿlehu, “raised him”), which seems to make better sense.) him in Pharaoh’s palace; Genubath grew up in Pharaoh’s palace among Pharaoh’s sons."},{"number":21,"verse":"While in Egypt Hadad heard that David had passed away (tn Heb “lay down with his fathers.”) and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead.

Though Hadad enjoyed a comfortable life in Egypt, when the Lord raised him up (apparently stirring up his desire for vengeance) he decided to leave the comforts of Egypt and return to Edom.)"},{"number":23,"verse":"God also brought against Solomon (tn Heb “him”; the referent (Solomon) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) another enemy, Rezon son of Eliada who had run away from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah."},{"number":24,"verse":"He gathered some men and organized a raiding band.
