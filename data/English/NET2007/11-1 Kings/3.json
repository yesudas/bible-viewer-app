He brought her to the City of David (sn The phrase City of David refers here to the fortress of Zion in Jerusalem, not to Bethlehem. See 2 Sam 5:7.) until he could finish building his residence and the temple of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem. (map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.)"},{"number":2,"verse":"Now the people were offering sacrifices at the high places, (sn Offering sacrifices at the high places. The “high places” were places of worship that were naturally or artificially elevated.) because in those days a temple had not yet been built to honor the LORD. (tn Heb “for the name of the Lord.” The word “name” sometimes refers to one’s reputation or honor (thus the translation here, “to honor the Lord”). The “name” of the Lord sometimes designates the Lord himself, being indistinguishable from the proper name.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"Solomon demonstrated his loyalty to the LORD by following (tn Heb “Solomon loved the Lord by walking in.”) the practices (tn Or “policies, rules.”) of his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places."},{"number":4,"verse":"The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, for it had the most prominent of the high places. (tn Heb “for it was the great high place.”) Solomon would offer up (tn The verb form is an imperfect, which is probably used here in a customary sense to indicate continued or repeated action in past time. See GKC 314 §107. b.) a thousand burnt sacrifices on the altar there."},{"number":5,"verse":"One night in Gibeon the LORD appeared (tn Or “revealed himself.”) to Solomon in a dream. God said, “Tell (tn Heb “ask.”) me what I should give you.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"Solomon replied, “You demonstrated (tn Heb “did.”) great loyalty to your servant, my father David, as he served (tn Heb “walked before.”) you faithfully, properly, and sincerely. (tn Heb “in faithfulness and in innocence and in uprightness of heart with you.”) You have maintained this great loyalty to this day by allowing his son to sit on his throne. (tn Heb “and you have kept to him this great loyalty and you gave to him a son [who] sits on his throne as this day.”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"Now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in my father David’s place, even though I am only a young man and am inexperienced. (tn Heb “and I do not know going out or coming in.”)"},{"number":8,"verse":"Your servant stands (tn There is no verb expressed in the Hebrew text; “stands” is supplied in the translation for clarification.) among your chosen people; (tn Heb “your people whom you have chosen.”) they are a great nation that is too numerous to count or number."},{"number":9,"verse":"So give your servant a discerning mind (tn Heb “a hearing heart.” (The Hebrew term translated “heart” often refers to the mental faculties.)) so he can make judicial decisions for (tn Heb “to judge.”) your people and distinguish right from wrong. (tn Heb “to understand between good and evil.”) Otherwise (tn Heb “for”; the word “otherwise” is used to reflect the logical sense of the statement.) no one is able (tn Heb “who is able?” The rhetorical question anticipates the answer, “no one.”) to make judicial decisions for (tn Heb “to judge.”) this great nation of yours.” (tn Heb “your numerous people.”)"},{"number":10,"verse":"The Lord (tn The Hebrew term translated “Lord” here and in v.15 is אֲדֹנָי (’adonay).) was pleased that Solomon made this request.

The translation assumes that the perfect tense here indicates that the action occurs as the statement is made (i. e., “right now I give you”).) you a wise and discerning mind (tn Heb “heart.” (The Hebrew term translated “heart” often refers to the mental faculties.)) superior to that of anyone who has preceded or will succeed you.

In other words, there were no other witnesses to the births who could identify which child belonged to which mother.)"},{"number":19,"verse":"This woman’s child suffocated (tn Heb “died.”) during the night when she rolled (tn Heb “lay, slept.”) on top of him."},{"number":20,"verse":"She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your servant was sleeping. She put him in her arms, and put her dead son in my arms."},{"number":21,"verse":"I got up in the morning to nurse my son, and there he was, (tn Heb “look.”) dead!

Let them cut him in two!”"},{"number":27,"verse":"The king responded, “Give the first woman the living child; don’t kill him. She is the mother.”"},{"number":28,"verse":"When all Israel heard about the judicial decision which the king had rendered, they respected (tn Heb “feared,” perhaps in the sense, “stood in awe of.”) the king, for they realized (tn Heb “saw.”) that he possessed supernatural wisdom (tn Heb “the wisdom of God within him.”) to make judicial decisions."}]}
