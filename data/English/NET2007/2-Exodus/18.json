{"bibleAbbr":"NET2007","bookName":"Exodus","bookEnglishName":"Exodus","chapterNumber":18,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"The Advice of Jethro (sn This chapter forms the transition to the Law. There has been the deliverance, the testing passages, the provision in the wilderness, and the warfare. Any God who can do all this for his people deserves their allegiance. In chap. 18 the Lawgiver is giving advice, using laws and rulings, but then he is given advice to organize the elders to assist. Thus, when the Law is fully revealed, a system will be in place to administer it. The point of the passage is that a great leader humbly accepts advice from other godly believers to delegate responsibility. He does not try to do it all himself; God does not want one individual to do it all. The chapter has three parts: vv. 1–12 tell how Jethro heard and came and worshiped and blessed; vv. 13–23 have the advice of Jethro, and then vv. 24–27 tell how Moses implemented the plan and Jethro went home. See further E. J. Runions, “Exodus Motifs in 1 Samuel 7 and 8,” EvQ 52 (1980): 130-31; and also see for another idea T. C. Butler, “An Anti-Moses Tradition,” JSOT 12 (1979): 9-15.) Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard about all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, that (tn This clause beginning with כִּי (ki) answers the question of what Jethro had heard; it provides a second, explanatory noun clause that is the object of the verb – “he heard (1) all that God had done… (2) that he had brought….” See R. J. Williams, Hebrew Syntax, 81, §490.) the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. (sn This is an important report that Jethro has heard, for the claim of God that he brought Israel out of bondage in Egypt will be the foundation of the covenant stipulations (Exod 20).)"},{"number":2,"verse":"Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Moses’ wife Zipporah after he had sent her back,"},{"number":3,"verse":"and her two sons, one of whom was named Gershom (for Moses (tn Heb “he”; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity (also in the following verse).) had said, “I have been a foreigner in a foreign land”),"},{"number":4,"verse":"and the other Eliezer (for Moses had said, (tn The referent (Moses) and the verb have been specified in the translation for clarity.) “The God of my father has been my help (tn Now is given the etymological explanation of the name of Moses’ other son, Eliezer (אֱלִיעֶזֶר, ’eli’ezer), which means “my God is a help.” The sentiment that explains this name is אֱלֹהֵי אָבִי בְּעֶזְרִי (’elohe ’avi bÿ’ezri, “the God of my father is my help”). The preposition in the sentiment is the bet (ב) essentiae (giving the essence – see GKC 379 §119. i). Not mentioned earlier, the name has become even more appropriate now that God has delivered Moses from Pharaoh again. The word for “help” is a common word in the Bible, first introduced as a description of the woman in the Garden. It means to do for someone what he or she cannot do for himself or herself. Samuel raised the “stone of help” (Ebenezer) when Yahweh helped Israel win the battle (1 Sam 7:12).) and delivered (sn The verb “delivered” is an important motif in this chapter (see its use in vv. 8, 9, and 10 with reference to Pharaoh).) me from the sword of Pharaoh”)."},{"number":5,"verse":"Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, together with Moses’ (tn Heb “his”; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) sons and his wife, came to Moses in the desert where he was camping by (tn This is an adverbial accusative that defines the place (see GKC 373-74 §118. g).) the mountain of God. (sn The mountain of God is Horeb, and so the desert here must be the Sinai desert by it. But chap. 19 suggests that they left Rephidim to go the 24 miles to Sinai. It may be that this chapter fits in chronologically after the move to Sinai, but was placed here thematically. W. C. Kaiser defends the present location of the story by responding to other reasons for the change given by Lightfoot, but does not deal with the travel locations (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., “Exodus,” EBC 2:411).)"},{"number":6,"verse":"He said (sn This verse may seem out of place, since the report has already been given that they came to the desert. It begins to provide details of the event that the previous verse summarizes. The announcement in verse 6 may have come in advance by means of a messenger or at the time of arrival, either of which would fit with the attention to formal greetings in verse 7. This would suit a meeting between two important men; the status of Moses has changed. The LXX solves the problem by taking the pronoun “I” as the particle “behold” and reads it this way: “one said to Moses, ‘Behold, your father-in-law has come….’”) to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you, along with your wife and her two sons with her.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him; (sn This is more than polite oriental custom.

Jacob, Exodus, 496).) they each asked about the other’s welfare, and then they went into the tent."},{"number":8,"verse":"Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt for Israel’s sake, and all the hardship (tn A rare word, “weariness” of the hardships.) that had come on them (tn Heb “found them.”) along the way, and how (tn Here “how” has been supplied.) the LORD had delivered them."},{"number":9,"verse":"Jethro rejoiced (tn The word חָדָה (khada) is rare, occurring only in Job 3:6 and Ps 21:6, although it is common in Aramaic.

Sanhedrin 94b, “he felt cuts in his body” – a wordplay on the verb (Exodus, 215-16).) because of all the good that the LORD had done for Israel, whom he had delivered from the hand of Egypt."},{"number":10,"verse":"Jethro said, “Blessed (tn This is a common form of praise. The verb בָּרוּךְ (barukh) is the Qal passive participle of the verb.

In the present translation the phrase “he has destroyed them” is supplied. Others take the last prepositional phrase to be the completion and supply only a verb: “[he was] above them.” U. Cassuto (Exodus, 216) takes the word “gods” to be the subject of the verb “act proudly,” giving the sense of “precisely (כִּי, ki) in respect of these things of which the gods of Egypt boasted – He is greater than they (עֲלֵיהֶם, ‘alehem).” He suggests rendering the clause, “excelling them in the very things to which they laid claim.”)"},{"number":12,"verse":"Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought (tn The verb is “and he took” (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB). It must have the sense of getting the animals for the sacrifice. The Syriac, Targum, and Vulgate have “offered.” But Cody argues because of the precise wording in the text Jethro did not offer the sacrifices but received them (A. Cody, “Exodus 1812: Jethro Accepts a Covenant with the Israelites,” Bib 49 [1968]: 159-61).) a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, (sn Jethro brought offerings as if he were the one who had been delivered. The “burnt offering” is singular, to honor God first. The other sacrifices were intended for the invited guests to eat (a forerunner of the peace offering). See B. Jacob, Exodus, 498.) and Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat food (tn The word לֶחֶם (lekhem) here means the sacrifice and all the foods that were offered with it. The eating before God was part of covenantal ritual, for it signified that they were in communion with the Deity, and with one another.) with the father-in-law of Moses before God."},{"number":13,"verse":"On the next day (tn Heb “and it was/happened on the morrow.”) Moses sat to judge (sn This is a simple summary of the function of Moses on this particular day. He did not necessarily do this every day, but it was time now to do it. The people would come to solve their difficulties or to hear instruction from Moses on decisions to be made.

Sitting alone all day and the people standing around all day showed that Moses was exhibiting too much care for the people – he could not do this.) Why are you sitting by yourself, and all the people stand around you from morning until evening?”"},{"number":15,"verse":"Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire (tn The form is לִדְרֹשׁ (lidrosh), the Qal infinitive construct giving the purpose. To inquire of God would be to seek God’s will on a matter, to obtain a legal decision on a matter, or to settle a dispute.

The psalms would later describe judges as “gods” because they made the right decisions based on God’s Law.) of God."},{"number":16,"verse":"When they have a dispute, (tn Or “thing,” “matter,” “issue.”) it comes to me and I decide (tn The verb שָׁפַט (shafat) means “to judge”; more specifically, it means to make a decision as an arbiter or umpire.

Driver suggests this is another reason why this event might have taken place after Yahweh had given laws on the mountain (Exodus, 165).)"},{"number":17,"verse":"Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “What (tn Heb “the thing.”) you are doing is not good!"},{"number":18,"verse":"You will surely wear out, (tn The verb means “to fall and fade” as a leaf (Ps 1:3).

Cassuto, Exodus, 219-20).) and you bring (tn The form is the perfect tense with the vav (ו) consecutive; following the imperative it will be instruction as well.

Spiritually responsible people are to be selected to help in the work of the ministry (teaching, deciding cases, meeting needs), so that there will be peace, and so that leaders will not be exhausted.
