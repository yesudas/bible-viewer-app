(tn Heb “Take with you all the people of war and arise, go up against Ai!”) See, I am handing over to you (tn Heb “I have given into our hand.” The verbal form, a perfect, is probably best understood as a perfect of certitude, indicating the certainty of the action.) the king of Ai, along with his people, city, and land."},{"number":2,"verse":"Do to Ai and its king what you did to Jericho (map For location see Map5-B2; Map6-E1; Map7-E1; Map8-E3; Map10-A2; Map11-A1.) and its king, except you may plunder its goods and cattle.

When they come out to fight us like before, we will retreat from them."},{"number":6,"verse":"They will attack (tn Heb “come out after.”) us until we have lured them from the city, for they will say, ‘They are retreating from us like before.’ We will retreat from them."},{"number":7,"verse":"Then you rise up from your hiding place (tn Heb “from the ambush.”) and seize (tn Heb “take possession of.”) the city. The LORD your God will hand it over to you."},{"number":8,"verse":"When you capture the city, set it (tn Heb “the city.”) on fire. Do as the LORD says! See, I have given you orders.” (tn Heb “I have commanded you.”)"},{"number":9,"verse":"Joshua sent them away and they went to their hiding place (tn Or “the place of ambush.”) west of Ai, between Bethel (map For location see Map4-G4; Map5-C1; Map6-E3; Map7-D1; Map8-G3.) and Ai.

Since the translation used “army” in the previous clause, a singular pronoun (“it”) is required in English.) to Ai."},{"number":11,"verse":"All the troops that were with him marched up and drew near the city. (tn Heb “All the people of war who were with him went up and approached and came opposite the city.”) They camped north of Ai on the other side of the valley.

(tn Heb “and there was not in them hands to flee here or there.” The Hebrew term יָדַיִם (yadayim, “hands”) is idiomatic for “strength.”) In the meantime the men who were retreating to the desert turned against their pursuers."},{"number":21,"verse":"When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that the city was going up in smoke, (tn Heb “and that the smoke of the city ascended.”) they turned around and struck down the men of Ai."},{"number":22,"verse":"At the same time the men who had taken the city came out to fight, and the men of Ai were trapped in the middle.

(tn Heb “on a tree until evening.” The words “leaving him exposed” are supplied in the translation for clarity.) At sunset Joshua ordered that his corpse be taken down from the tree.

As described in the law scroll of Moses, it was made with uncut stones untouched by an iron tool. (tn Heb “as it is written in the scroll of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones on which no one had wielded iron.” The expression “whole stones” refers to stones in their natural condition, i. e., not carved or shaped artificially with tools (“wielded iron”).) They offered burnt sacrifices on it and sacrificed tokens of peace. (tn Or “peace offerings.”)"},{"number":32,"verse":"There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua inscribed on the stones a duplicate of the law written by Moses.

Both resident foreigners and native Israelites were there. (tn Heb “like the resident alien, like the citizen.” The language is idiomatic, meaning that both groups were treated the same, at least in this instance.) Half the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and the other half in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the LORD’s servant had previously instructed to them to do for the formal blessing ceremony. (tn Heb “as Moses, the Lord’s servant, commanded to bless the people, Israel, formerly.”sn Moses’ earlier instructions are found in Deut 11:29.)"},{"number":34,"verse":"Then (tn Or “afterward.”) Joshua read aloud all the words of the law, including the blessings and the curses, just as they are written in the law scroll."},{"number":35,"verse":"Joshua read aloud every commandment Moses had given (tn Heb “There was not a word from all which Moses commanded that Joshua did not read aloud.”) before the whole assembly of Israel, including the women, children, and resident foreigners who lived among them.
