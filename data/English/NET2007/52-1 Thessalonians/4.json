The Greek word translated received is used for accepting instructions passed on as fixed traditions from teacher to follower. Paul speaks in these terms about doctrinal traditions as well as ethical instruction that he passes on to his converts and expects them to keep (cf. 1 Cor 11:2, 23; 15:1–3; Gal 1:9; Phil 4:9; 2 Thess 2:15; 3:6).) you must live and please God (as you are in fact living) (tc This parenthetical clause is absent in several later witnesses (D2 Ψ Ï), but it may have been expunged for sounding redundant.

Some take it to mean “wife” (thus, “to take a wife for himself” or “to live with his wife”), but this is less likely. See J. Smith, “1 Thess 4:4 – Breaking the Impasse,” BBR 10 (Fall 2000), who argues that “vessel” in this context is very likely a euphemism for the sexual organs.) in holiness and honor,"},{"number":5,"verse":"not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God."},{"number":6,"verse":"In this matter no one should violate the rights of his brother or take advantage of him, (tn Grk “not to transgress against or defraud his brother in the matter,” continuing the sentence of vv. 3–5.) because the Lord is the avenger in all these cases, (tn Grk “concerning all these things.”) as we also told you earlier and warned you solemnly."},{"number":7,"verse":"For God did not call us to impurity but in holiness."},{"number":8,"verse":"Consequently the one who rejects this is not rejecting human authority (tn Grk “rejecting man.”) but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you."},{"number":9,"verse":"Now on the topic of brotherly love (tn Grk “concerning brotherly love.”) you have no need for anyone to write you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another."},{"number":10,"verse":"And indeed you are practicing it toward all the brothers and sisters (tn Grk “brothers”; this applies to the second occurrence as well.

This metaphorical usage by its very nature emphasizes the hope of resurrection: Believers will one day “wake up” out of death. Here the term refers to death, but “sleep” was used in the translation to emphasize the metaphorical, rhetorical usage of the term. This word also occurs in vv. 14 and 15.) so that you will not grieve like the rest who have no hope."},{"number":14,"verse":"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that (tn “we believe that” is understood from the first clause of the verse, which is parallel.

(tn Grk “those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.” It is possible that “through Jesus” describes “bring,” but this gives the unlikely double reference, “through Jesus God will bring them with Jesus.” Instead it describes their “falling sleep,” since through him their death is only sleep and not the threat it once was. Also Christians are those whose total existence – life and death – is in and through and for Christ (1 Cor 8:6).)"},{"number":15,"verse":"For we tell you this by the word of the Lord, (sn The word of the Lord is a technical expression in OT literature, often referring to a divine prophetic utterance (e. g., Gen 15:1, Isa 1:10, Jonah 1:1). In the NT it occurs 15 times: 3 times as ῥῆμα τοῦ κυρίου (rJhma tou kuriou; Luke 22:61, Acts 11:16, 1 Pet 1:25) and 12 times as λόγος τοῦ κυρίου (logo\" tou kuriou; here and in Acts 8:25; 13:44, 48, 49; 15:35, 36; 16:32; 19:10, 20; 1 Thess 1:8; 2 Thess 3:1).
