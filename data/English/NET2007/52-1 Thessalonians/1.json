Apart from a desire to omit the redundancy of the mention of God and Christ in this verse, there is no good reason why scribes would have omitted the characteristically Pauline greeting. (Further, if this were the case, why did these same scribes overlook such an opportunity in 2 Thess 1:1–2?) On the other hand, since 1 Thessalonians is one of Paul’s earliest letters, what would become characteristic of his greetings seems to have been still in embryonic form (e. g., he does not yet call his audience “saints” [which will first be used in his address to the Corinthians], nor does he use ἐν (en) plus the dative to refer to the location of the church). Thus, the internal evidence is overwhelming in support of the shorter reading, for scribes would have been strongly motivated to rework this salutation in light of Paul’s style elsewhere. And the external evidence, though not overwhelming, is supportive of this shorter reading, found as it is in some of the best witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western texttypes. tn Grk “Grace to you and peace.”)"},{"number":2,"verse":"(Thanksgiving for Response to the Gospel) We thank God always for all of you as we mention you constantly (tn Or “mention you in our prayers, because we recall constantly…”) in our prayers,"},{"number":3,"verse":"because we recall (tn Grk “making mention…recalling.” The participle ποιούμενοι (poioumenoi) in v. 2 has been translated as temporal, and μνημονεύοντες (mnhmoneuonte\") in v. 3 has been translated as causal.) in the presence of our God and Father (tn Or the phrase may connect at the end of the verse: “hope…in the presence of our God and Father.”) your work of faith and labor of love and endurance of hope (tn These phrases denote Christian virtues in action: the work produced by faith, labor motivated by love, and endurance that stems from hope in Christ.) in our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"number":4,"verse":"We know, (tn Grk “knowing.” Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, the participle εἰδότες (eidotes) has been translated as a finite verb and a new sentence started here in the translation.) brothers and sisters (tn Grk “brothers,” but the Greek word may be used for “brothers and sisters” or “fellow Christians” as here (cf.
