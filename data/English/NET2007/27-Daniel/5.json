C.) who was king of Babylon at this time. However, Nabonidus spent long periods of time at Teima, and during those times Belshazzar his son was de facto king of Babylon. This arrangement may help to explain why later in this chapter Belshazzar promises that the successful interpreter of the handwriting on the wall will be made third ruler in the kingdom. If Belshazzar was in effect second ruler in the kingdom, this would be the highest honor he could grant.) prepared a great banquet (sn This scene of a Babylonian banquet calls to mind a similar grandiose event recorded in Esth 1:3–8. Persian kings were also renowned in the ancient Near Eastern world for their lavish banquets.) for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in front of (sn The king probably sat at an elevated head table.) them all. (tn Aram “the thousand.”)"},{"number":2,"verse":"While under the influence (tn Or perhaps, “when he had tasted” (cf. NASB) in the sense of officially initiating the commencement of the banquet. The translation above seems preferable, however, given the clear evidence of inebriation in the context (cf. also CEV “he got drunk and ordered”).) of the wine, Belshazzar issued an order to bring in the gold and silver vessels — the ones that Nebuchadnezzar his father (tn Or “ancestor”; or “predecessor” (also in vv. 11, 13, 18). The Aramaic word translated “father” can on occasion denote these other relationships.) had confiscated (tn Or “taken.”) from the temple in Jerusalem (map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) — so that the king and his nobles, together with his wives and his concubines, could drink from them. (sn Making use of sacred temple vessels for an occasion of reveling and drunkenness such as this would have been a religious affront of shocking proportions to the Jewish captives.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"So they brought the gold and silver (tc The present translation reads וְכַסְפָּא (vÿkhaspa’, “and the silver”) with Theodotion and the Vulgate. Cf. v. 2. The form was probably accidentally dropped from the Aramaic text by homoioteleuton.) vessels that had been confiscated from the temple, the house of God (tn Aram “the temple of the house of God.” The phrase seems rather awkward.

(sn The mention of the lampstand in this context is of interest because it suggests that the writing was in clear view.) The king was watching the back (tn While Aramaic פַּס (pas) can mean the palm of the hand, here it seems to be the back of the hand that is intended.) of the hand that was writing."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then all the color drained from the king’s face (tn Aram “[the king’s] brightness changed for him.”) and he became alarmed.

The king proclaimed (tn Aram “answered and said.”) to the wise men of Babylon that anyone who could read this inscription and disclose its interpretation would be clothed in purple (sn Purple was a color associated with royalty in the ancient world.) and have a golden collar (tn The term translated “golden collar” here probably refers to something more substantial than merely a gold chain (cf. NIV, NCV, NRSV, NLT) or necklace (cf. NASB).) placed on his neck and be third ruler in the kingdom."},{"number":8,"verse":"So all the king’s wise men came in, but they were unable to read the writing or to make known its (tc Read וּפִשְׁרֵהּ (ufishreh) with the Qere rather than וּפִשְׁרָא (ufishra’) of the Kethib.) interpretation to the king."},{"number":9,"verse":"Then King Belshazzar was very terrified, and he was visibly shaken.

His nobles were completely dumbfounded."},{"number":10,"verse":"Due to the noise (tn Aram “words of the king.”) caused by the king and his nobles, the queen mother (tn Aram “the queen” (so NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV). In the following discourse this woman is able to recall things about Daniel that go back to the days of Nebuchadnezzar, things that Belshazzar does not seem to recollect. It is likely that she was the wife not of Belshazzar but of Nabonidus or perhaps even Nebuchadnezzar. In that case, “queen” here means “queen mother” (cf. NCV “the king’s mother”).) then entered the banquet room. She (tn Aram “The queen.” The translation has used the pronoun “she” instead because repetition of the noun here would be redundant in terms of English style.) said, “O king, live forever! Don’t be alarmed! Don’t be shaken!"},{"number":11,"verse":"There is a man in your kingdom who has within him a spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, he proved to have (tn Aram “[there were] discovered to be in him.”) insight, discernment, and wisdom like that (tn Aram “wisdom like the wisdom.” This would be redundant in terms of English style.) of the gods. (tc Theodotion lacks the phrase “and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods.”) King Nebuchadnezzar your father appointed him chief of the magicians, astrologers, wise men, and diviners. (tc The MT includes a redundant reference to “your father the king” at the end of v. 11. None of the attempts to explain this phrase as original are very convincing. The present translation deletes the phrase, following Theodotion and the Syriac.)"},{"number":12,"verse":"Thus there was found in this man Daniel, whom the king renamed Belteshazzar, an extraordinary spirit, knowledge, and skill to interpret (tc The translation reads מִפְשַׁר (mifshar) rather than the MT מְפַשַּׁר (mÿfashar) and later in the verse reads וּמִשְׁרֵא (mishre’) rather than the MT וּמְשָׁרֵא (mÿshare’).

As such, they have an epexegetical function in the syntax of their clause.) dreams, solve riddles, and decipher knotty problems.

You brought before you the vessels from his temple, and you and your nobles, together with your wives and concubines, drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone — gods (tn Aram “which.”) that cannot see or hear or comprehend!

NAB “PERES”).)"},{"number":26,"verse":"This is the interpretation of the words: (tn Or “word” or “event.” See HALOT 1915 s. v. מִלָּה.) As for mene (tn The Aramaic term מְנֵא (mÿne’) is a noun referring to a measure of weight. The linkage here to the verb “to number” (Aram. מְנָה, mÿnah) is a case of paronomasia rather than strict etymology. So also with תְּקֵל (tÿqel) and פַרְסִין (farsin).
