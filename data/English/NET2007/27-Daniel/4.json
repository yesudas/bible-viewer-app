Thus Dan 3:31–33 of the Aramaic text appears as Dan 4:1–3 in the English Bible, and the corresponding verses of ch. 4 differ accordingly. In spite of the division of the Aramaic text, a good case can be made that 3:31–33 AT (= 4:1–3 ET) is actually the introduction to ch. 4.) “King Nebuchadnezzar, to all peoples, nations, and language groups that live in all the land: Peace and prosperity!

The Greek OT (LXX) has the following addition: “In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign he said.” This date would suggest a link to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B. C. In general, the LXX of chapters 4-6 is very different from the MT, so much so that the following notes will call attention only to selected readings. In Daniel 4 the LXX lacks sizable portions of material in the MT (e. g., vv. 3–6, 31–32), includes sizable portions of material not in the MT (e. g., v. 14a, parts of vv. 16, 28), has a different order of some material (e. g., v. 8 after v. 9), and in some instances is vastly different from the MT (e. g., vv. 30, 34). Whether these differences are due to an excessively paraphrastic translation technique adopted for these chapters in the LXX, or are due to differences in the underlying Vorlage of the LXX, is a disputed matter. The latter seems more likely. There is a growing trend in modern scholarship to take the LXX of chapters 4-6 much more seriously than was the case in most earlier text-critical studies that considered this issue.)

But they were unable to make known its interpretation to me."},{"number":8,"verse":"Later Daniel entered (whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god, (sn This explanation of the meaning of the name Belteshazzar may be more of a paronomasia than a strict etymology.) and in whom there is a spirit of the holy gods).
