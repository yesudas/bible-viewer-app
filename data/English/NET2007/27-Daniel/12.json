And those bringing many to righteousness will be like the stars forever and ever."},{"number":4,"verse":"“But you, Daniel, close up these words and seal the book until the time of the end. Many will dash about, (tn Or “will run back and forth”; KJV “shall run to and fro”; NIV “will go here and there”; CEV “will go everywhere.”sn Many will dash about is probably an allusion to Amos 8:12.) and knowledge will increase.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"I, Daniel, watched as two others stood there, one on each side of the river.
