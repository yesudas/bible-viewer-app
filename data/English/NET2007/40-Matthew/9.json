To claim divine prerogatives or claim to speak for God when one really does not would be such an act of offense. The remark raised directly the issue of the nature of Jesus’ ministry.)"},{"number":4,"verse":"When Jesus saw their reaction he said, “Why do you respond with evil in your hearts?"},{"number":5,"verse":"Which is easier, (sn Which is easier is a reflective kind of question. On the one hand to declare sins are forgiven is easier, since one does not need to see it, unlike telling a paralyzed person to walk. On the other hand, it is harder, because for it to be true one must possess the authority to forgive the sin.) to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?"},{"number":6,"verse":"But so that you may know (sn Now Jesus put the two actions together. The walking of the man would be proof (so that you may know) that his sins were forgiven and that God had worked through Jesus (i. e., the Son of Man).) that the Son of Man (sn The term Son of Man, which is a title in Greek, comes from a pictorial description in Dan 7:13 of one “like a son of man” (i. e., a human being). It is Jesus’ favorite way to refer to himself. Jesus did not reveal the background of the term here, which mixes human and divine imagery as the man in Daniel rides a cloud, something only God does. He just used it. It also could be an idiom in Aramaic meaning either “some person” or “me.” So there is a little ambiguity in its use here, since its origin is not clear at this point. However, the action makes it clear that Jesus used it to refer to himself here.) has authority on earth to forgive sins” — then he said to the paralytic (sn Jesus did not finish his sentence with words but with action, that is, healing the paralytic with an accompanying pronouncement to him directly.) — “Stand up, take your stretcher, and go home.” (tn Grk “to your house.”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"And he stood up and went home.

(tn Grk “people.” The plural of ἄνθρωπος (anqrwpo\") usually indicates people in general, but the singular is used in the expression “Son of Man.” There is thus an ironic allusion to Jesus’ statement in v. 6: His self-designation as “Son of Man” is meant to be unique, but the crowd regards it simply as meaning “human, person.” To maintain this connection for the English reader the plural ἀνθρώποις (anqrwpoi\") has been translated here as “men” rather than as the more generic “people.”)"},{"number":9,"verse":"The Call of Matthew; Eating with Sinners As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth. (tn While “tax office” is sometimes given as a translation for τελώνιον (telwnion, so L&N 57.183), this could give the modern reader a false impression of an indoor office with all its associated furnishings. sn The tax booth was a booth located on the edge of a city or town to collect taxes for trade. There was a tax booth in Capernaum, which was on the trade route from Damascus to Galilee and the Mediterranean. The “taxes” were collected on produce and goods brought into the area for sale, and were a sort of “sales tax” paid by the seller but obviously passed on to the purchaser in the form of increased prices (L&N 57.183). It was here that Jesus met Matthew (also named Levi [see Mark 2:14, Luke 5:27]) who was ultimately employed by the Romans, though perhaps more directly responsible to Herod Antipas. It was his job to collect taxes for Rome and he was thus despised by Jews who undoubtedly regarded him as a traitor.) “Follow me,” he said to him.

Jews were very careful about personal associations and contact as a matter of ritual cleanliness. Their question borders on an accusation that Jesus is ritually unclean.)"},{"number":12,"verse":"When (tn Here δέ (de) has not been translated.) Jesus heard this he said, “Those who are healthy don’t need a physician, but those who are sick do. (sn Jesus’ point is that he associates with those who are sick because they have the need and will respond to the offer of help. A person who is healthy (or who thinks mistakenly that he is) will not seek treatment.)"},{"number":13,"verse":"Go and learn what this saying means: ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice.’ (sn A quotation from Hos 6:6 (see also Matt 12:7).)

Putting new (unfermented) wine in old wineskins, which had already been stretched, would result in the bursting of the wineskins.) otherwise the skins burst and the wine is spilled out and the skins are destroyed. Instead they put new wine into new wineskins (sn The meaning of the saying new wine into new wineskins is that the presence and teaching of Jesus was something new and signaled the passing of the old.
