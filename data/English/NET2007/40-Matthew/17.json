(sn In 1st century Judaism and in the NT, there was the belief that the righteous get new, glorified bodies in order to enter heaven (1 Cor 15:42–49; 2 Cor 5:1–10). This transformation means the righteous will share the glory of God. One recalls the way Moses shared the Lord’s glory after his visit to the mountain in Exod 34. So the disciples saw Jesus transfigured, and they were getting a sneak preview of the great glory that Jesus would have (only his glory is more inherent to him as one who shares in the rule of the kingdom).) His (tn Here καί (kai) has not been translated.) face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light."},{"number":3,"verse":"Then Moses (tn Grk “And behold, Moses.” The Greek word ἰδού (idou) has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s. v. 1).) and Elijah (sn Commentators and scholars discuss why Moses and Elijah are present. The most likely explanation is that Moses represents the prophetic office (Acts 3:18–22) and Elijah pictures the presence of the last days (Mal 4:5–6), the prophet of the eschaton (the end times).) also appeared before them, talking with him."},{"number":4,"verse":"So (tn Here δέ (de) has been translated as “so” to indicate that the appearance of Moses and Elijah prompted Peter’s comment.) Peter said (tn Grk “Peter answering said.” This construction is somewhat redundant and has been simplified in the translation.) to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, I will make (tc Instead of the singular future indicative ποιήσω (poihsw, “I will make”), most witnesses (C3 D L W Θ [Φ] 0281 Ë[1],13 33 Ï lat sy co) have the plural aorist subjunctive ποιήσωμεν (poihswmen, “let us make”). But since ποιήσωμεν is the reading found in the parallel accounts in Mark and Luke, it is almost surely a motivated reading. Further, the earliest and best witnesses, as well as a few others (א B C* 700 pc) have ποιήσω. It is thus more likely that the singular verb is authentic.) three shelters (tn Or “booths,” “dwellings” (referring to the temporary booths constructed in the celebration of the feast of Tabernacles). sn Peter apparently wanted to celebrate the feast of Tabernacles or Booths that looked forward to the end and wanted to treat Moses, Elijah, and Jesus as equals by making three shelters (one for each). It was actually a way of expressing honor to Jesus, but the next verse makes it clear that it was not enough honor.) — one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"While he was still speaking, a (tn Grk “behold, a.” The Greek word ἰδού (idou) has not been translated here or in the following clause because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s. v. 1).) bright cloud (sn This cloud is the cloud of God’s presence and the voice is his as well.) overshadowed (tn Or “surrounded.”) them, and a voice from the cloud said, (tn Grk “behold, a voice from the cloud, saying.” This is an incomplete sentence in Greek which portrays intensity and emotion. The participle λέγουσα (legousa) was translated as a finite verb in keeping with English style.) “This is my one dear Son, (tn Grk “my beloved Son,” or “my Son, the beloved [one].” The force of ἀγαπητός (agaphtos) is often “pertaining to one who is the only one of his or her class, but at the same time is particularly loved and cherished” (L&N 58.53; cf. also BDAG 7 s. v. 1).) in whom I take great delight. Listen to him!” (sn The expression listen to him comes from Deut 18:15 and makes two points: 1) Jesus is a prophet like Moses, a leader-prophet, and 2) they have much yet to learn from him.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"When the disciples heard this, they were overwhelmed with fear and threw themselves down with their faces to the ground.

As B. M. Metzger notes, “Since there is no satisfactory reason why the passage, if originally present in Matthew, should have been omitted in a wide variety of witnesses, and since copyists frequently inserted material derived from another Gospel, it appears that most manuscripts have been assimilated to the parallel in Mk 9.29” (TCGNT 35).

(tn The plural Greek term ἀνθρώπων (anqrwpwn) is considered by some to be used here in a generic sense, referring to both men and women (cf. NRSV “into human hands”; TEV, CEV “to people”). However, because this can be taken as a specific reference to the group responsible for Jesus’ arrest, where it is unlikely women were present (cf. Matt 26:47–56; Mark 14:43–52; Luke 22:47–53; John 18:2–12), the word “men” has been retained in the translation.

BDAG 241 s. v.). Even though this coin was no longer in circulation in NT times and other coins were used to pay the tax, the name for the coin was still used to refer to the tax itself. sn The temple tax refers to the half-shekel tax paid annually by male Jews to support the temple (Exod 30:13–16).) came to Peter and said, “Your teacher pays the double drachma tax, doesn’t he?”"},{"number":25,"verse":"He said, “Yes.” When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, (tn Grk “spoke first to him, saying.” The participle λέγων (legwn) is redundant in English and has not been translated.) “What do you think, Simon?
