In general, parables usually advance a single idea, though there may be many parts and characters in a single parable and subordinate ideas may expand the main idea further. The beauty of using the parable as a teaching device is that it draws the listener into the story, elicits an evaluation, and demands a response.) saying: “Listen! (tn Grk “Behold.”) A sower went out to sow. (sn A sower went out to sow. The background for this well-known parable, drawn from a typical scene in the Palestinian countryside, is a field through which a well-worn path runs. Sowing would occur in late fall or early winter (October to December) in the rainy season, looking for sprouting in April or May and a June harvest. The use of seed as a figure for God’s giving life has OT roots (Isa 55:10–11). The point of the parable of the sower is to illustrate the various responses to the message of the kingdom of God.)"},{"number":4,"verse":"And as he sowed, some seeds (tn In Matthew’s version of this parable, plural pronouns are used to refer to the seed in v. 4 (ἅ…αὐτά [Ja…auta]), although the collective singular is used in v. 5 and following (indicated by the singular verbs like ἔπεσεν [epesen]). For the sake of consistency in English, plural pronouns referring to the seed are used in the translation throughout the Matthean account. In both Mark and Luke the collective singular is used consistently throughout (cf. Mark 4:1–9; Luke 8:4–8).) fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them."},{"number":5,"verse":"Other (tn Here and in vv. 7 and 8 δέ (de) has not been translated.) seeds fell on rocky ground (sn The rocky ground in Palestine would be a limestone base lying right under the soil.) where they did not have much soil.

Jesus seems to be explaining how current events develop old promises, since the NT consistently links the events of Jesus’ ministry and message with old promises (Rom 1:1–4; Heb 1:1–2). The traditional translation of this word, “mystery,” is misleading to the modern English reader because it suggests a secret which people have tried to uncover but which they have failed to understand (L&N 28.77).) of the kingdom of heaven, but they have not."},{"number":12,"verse":"For whoever has will be given more, and will have an abundance.

The meaning is that the one who accepts Jesus’ teaching concerning his person and the kingdom will receive a share in the kingdom now and even more in the future, but for the one who rejects Jesus’ words, the opportunity that that person presently possesses with respect to the kingdom will someday be taken away forever.)"},{"number":13,"verse":"For this reason I speak to them in parables: Although they see they do not see, and although they hear they do not hear nor do they understand."},{"number":14,"verse":"And concerning them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: ‘You will listen carefully (tn Grk “with hearing,” a cognate dative that intensifies the action of the main verb “you will listen” (ExSyn 168-69).) yet will never understand, you will look closely (tn Grk “look by looking.” The participle is redundant, functioning to intensify the force of the main verb.) yet will never comprehend."},{"number":15,"verse":"For the heart of this people has become dull; they are hard of hearing, and they have shut their eyes, so that they would not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.’"},{"number":16,"verse":"“But your eyes are blessed (sn This beatitude highlights the great honor bestowed on the disciples to share in this salvation.) because they see, and your ears because they hear."},{"number":17,"verse":"For I tell you the truth, (tn Grk “truly (ἀμήν, amhn) I say to you.”) many prophets and righteous people longed to see (sn This is what past prophets and righteous people had wanted very much to see, yet the fulfillment had come to the disciples.

This could refer to one of two types of mustard plant popular in Palestine and would be either ten or twenty-five ft (3 or 7.5 m) tall.) so that the wild birds (tn Grk “the birds of the sky” or “the birds of the heaven”; the Greek word οὐρανός (ouranos) may be translated either “sky” or “heaven,” depending on the context. The idiomatic expression “birds of the sky” refers to wild birds as opposed to domesticated fowl (cf. BDAG 809 s. v. πετεινόν).) come and nest in its branches.” (sn The point of the parable seems to be that while the kingdom of God may appear to have insignificant and unnoticeable beginnings (i. e., in the ministry of Jesus), it will someday (i. e., at the second advent) be great and quite expansive. The kingdom, however, is not to be equated with the church, but rather the church is an expression of the kingdom. Also, there is important OT background in the image of the mustard seed that grew and became a tree: Ezek 17:22–24 pictures the reemergence of the Davidic house where people can find calm and shelter. Like the mustard seed, it would start out small but grow to significant size.)"},{"number":33,"verse":"(The Parable of the Yeast) He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with (tn Grk “hid in.”) three measures (sn This measure was a saton, the Greek name for the Hebrew term “seah.” Three of these was a very large quantity of flour, since a saton is a little over 16 pounds (7 kg) of dry measure (or 13.13 liters). So this was over 47 lbs (21 kg) of flour total, enough to feed over a hundred people.) of flour until all the dough had risen.” (tn Grk “it was all leavened.”sn The parable of the yeast and the dough teaches that the kingdom of God will start small but eventually grow to permeate everything. Jesus’ point was not to be deceived by its seemingly small start, the same point made in the parable of the mustard seed, which preceded this one.)"},{"number":34,"verse":"(The Purpose of Parables) Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds; he did not speak to them without a parable."},{"number":35,"verse":"This fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet: (tc A few important mss (א* Θ Ë113 33) identify the prophet as Isaiah, a reading that is significantly harder than the generic “prophet” because the source of this prophecy is not Isaiah but Asaph in Ps 78. Jerome mentioned some mss that had “Asaph” here, though none are known to exist today. This problem is difficult because of the temptation for scribes to delete the reference to Isaiah in order to clear up a discrepancy. Indeed, the vast majority of witnesses have only “the prophet” here (א1 B C D L W 0233 0242 Ï lat sy co). However, as B. M. Metzger points out, “if no prophet were originally named, more than one scribe might have been prompted to insert the name of the best known prophet – something which has, in fact, happened elsewhere more than once” (TCGNT 27). In light of the paucity of evidence for the reading ᾿Ησαΐου, as well as the proclivity of scribes to add his name, it is probably best to consider the shorter reading as authentic. tn Grk “was spoken by the prophet, saying.” The participle λέγοντος (legontos) is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.) “I will open my mouth in parables, I will announce what has been hidden from the foundation of the world.” (sn A quotation from Ps 78:2.)"},{"number":36,"verse":"(Explanation for the Disciples) Then he left the crowds and went into the house.
