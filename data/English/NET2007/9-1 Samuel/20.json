He came to Jonathan and asked, (tn Heb “and he came and said before Jonathan.”) “What have I done? What is my offense? (tn Heb “What is my guilt?”) How have I sinned before your father? For he is seeking my life!”"},{"number":2,"verse":"Jonathan (tn Heb “he”; the referent (Jonathan) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) said to him, “By no means are you going to die! My father does nothing (tc The translation follows the Qere, many medieval Hebrew mss, and the ancient versions in reading “he will not do,” rather than the Kethib of the MT (“do to him”).) large or small without making me aware of it.

It just won’t happen!”"},{"number":3,"verse":"Taking an oath, David again (tc The LXX and the Syriac Peshitta lack the word “again.”) said, “Your father is very much aware of the fact (tn The infinitive absolute appears before the finite verb for emphasis.) that I have found favor with you, and he has thought, (tn Heb “said,” that is, to himself. So also in v. 25.) ‘Don’t let Jonathan know about this, or he will be upset.’ But as surely as the LORD lives and you live, there is about one step between me and death!”"},{"number":4,"verse":"Jonathan replied to David, “Tell me what I can do for you.” (tn Heb “whatever your soul says, I will do for you.”)"},{"number":5,"verse":"David said to Jonathan, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and I am certainly expected to join the king for a meal. (tn Heb “and I must surely sit with the king to eat.” The infinitive absolute appears before the finite verb for emphasis.) You must send me away so I can hide in the field until the third evening from now."},{"number":6,"verse":"If your father happens to miss me, you should say, ‘David urgently requested me to let him go (tn Heb “to run.”) to his city Bethlehem, (map For location see Map5-B1; Map7-E2; Map8-E2; Map10-B4.) for there is an annual sacrifice there for his entire family.’"},{"number":7,"verse":"If he should then say, ‘That’s fine,’ (tn Heb “good.”) then your servant is safe. But if he becomes very angry, be assured that he has decided to harm me. (tn Heb “know that the evil is completed from with him.”)"},{"number":8,"verse":"You must be loyal (tn Heb “and you must do loyalty.”) to your servant, for you have made a covenant with your servant in the LORD’s name.

Let’s go out to the field.” When the two of them had gone out into the field,"},{"number":12,"verse":"Jonathan said to David, “The LORD God of Israel is my witness. (tc The Hebrew text has simply “the Lord God of Israel.” On the basis of the Syriac version, many reconstruct the text to read “[is] my witness,” which may have fallen out of the text by homoioarcton (an error which is entirely possible if עֵד, ’ed, “witness,” immediately followed ַָדוִד, “David,” in the original text).)

(tn The word order is different in the Hebrew text, which reads “and Jonathan cut with the house of David, and the Lord will seek from the hand of the enemies of David.” The translation assumes that the main clauses of the verse have been accidentally transposed in the course of transmission. The first part of the verse (as it stands in MT) belongs with v. 17, while the second part of the verse actually continues v. 15.)"},{"number":17,"verse":"Jonathan once again took an oath with David, because he loved him. In fact Jonathan loved him as much as he did his own life.

Stay near the stone Ezel."},{"number":20,"verse":"I will shoot three arrows near it, as though I were shooting at a target."},{"number":21,"verse":"When I send a boy after them, I will say, “Go and find the arrows.” If I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; (tn Heb “from you and here.”) get them,’ then come back.

For in that case the LORD has sent you away."},{"number":23,"verse":"With regard to the matter that you and I discussed, the LORD is the witness between us forever!” (tc Heb “the Lord [is] between me and between you forever.” The translation assumes that the original text read עֵד עַד־עוֹלָם (’ed ’ad-’olam), “a witness forever,” with the noun “a witness” accidentally falling out of the text by haplography. See P. K. McCarter, I Samuel (AB), 338.)"},{"number":24,"verse":"So David hid in the field. When the new moon came, the king sat down to eat his meal."},{"number":25,"verse":"The king sat down in his usual place by the wall, with Jonathan opposite him (tc Heb “and Jonathan arose.” Instead of MT’s וַיָּקָם (vayyaqam, “and he arose”; from the hollow verbal root קוּם, qum), the translation assumes a reading וַיִּקַדֵּם (vayyiqaddem, “and he was in front of”; from the verbal root קדם, qdm). See P. K. McCarter, I Samuel (AB), 338.) and Abner at his side. (tn Heb “and Abner sat at the side of Saul.”) But David’s place was vacant."},{"number":26,"verse":"However, Saul said nothing about it (tn The words “about it” are not present in the Hebrew text, although they are implied.) that day, for he thought, (tn Heb “said,” that is, to himself.) “Something has happened to make him ceremonially unclean. Yes, he must be unclean.”"},{"number":27,"verse":"But the next morning, the second day of the new moon, David’s place was still vacant. So Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why has Jesse’s son not come to the meal yesterday or today?”"},{"number":28,"verse":"Jonathan replied to Saul, “David urgently requested that he be allowed to go to Bethlehem."},{"number":29,"verse":"He said, ‘Permit me to go, (tn Heb “send me.”) for we are having a family sacrifice in the city, and my brother urged (tn Heb “commanded.”) me to be there. So now, if I have found favor with you, let me go (tn Heb “be released [from duty].”) to see my brothers.’ For that reason he has not come to the king’s table.”"},{"number":30,"verse":"Saul became angry with Jonathan (tc Many medieval Hebrew mss include the words “his son” here.) and said to him, “You stupid traitor! (tn Heb “son of a perverse woman of rebelliousness.” But such an overly literal and domesticated translation of the Hebrew expression fails to capture the force of Saul’s unrestrained reaction. Saul, now incensed and enraged over Jonathan’s liaison with David, is actually hurling very coarse and emotionally charged words at his son. The translation of this phrase suggested by Koehler and Baumgartner is “bastard of a wayward woman” (HALOT 796 s. v. עוה), but this is not an expression commonly used in English. A better English approximation of the sentiments expressed here by the Hebrew phrase would be “You stupid son of a bitch!” However, sensitivity to the various public formats in which the Bible is read aloud has led to a less startling English rendering which focuses on the semantic value of Saul’s utterance (i. e., the behavior of his own son Jonathan, which he viewed as both a personal and a political betrayal [= “traitor”]). But this concession should not obscure the fact that Saul is full of bitterness and frustration. That he would address his son Jonathan with such language, not to mention his apparent readiness even to kill his own son over this friendship with David (v. 33), indicates something of the extreme depth of Saul’s jealousy and hatred of David.) Don’t I realize that to your own disgrace and to the disgrace of your mother’s nakedness you have chosen this son of Jesse?"},{"number":31,"verse":"For as long as (tn Heb “all the days that.”) this son of Jesse is alive on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established. Now, send some men (tn The words “some men” are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.) and bring him to me. For he is as good as dead!” (tn Heb “a son of death.”)"},{"number":32,"verse":"Jonathan responded to his father Saul, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”"},{"number":33,"verse":"Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan (tn Heb “him”; the referent (Jonathan) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) in order to strike him down. So Jonathan was convinced (tn Heb “knew.”) that his father had decided to kill David."},{"number":34,"verse":"Jonathan got up from the table enraged. He did not eat any food on that second day of the new moon, for he was upset that his father had humiliated David. (tn Heb “for he was upset concerning David for his father had humiliated him.” The referent of the pronoun “him” is not entirely clear, but the phrase “concerning David” suggests that it refers to David, rather than Jonathan.)"},{"number":35,"verse":"The next morning Jonathan, along with a young servant, went out to the field to meet David."},{"number":36,"verse":"He said to his servant, “Run, find the arrows that I am about to shoot.” As the servant ran, Jonathan (tn Heb “he”; the referent (Jonathan) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) shot the arrow beyond him."},{"number":37,"verse":"When the servant came to the place where Jonathan had shot the arrow, Jonathan called out to (tn Heb “called after” (also in v. 38).) the servant, “Isn’t the arrow further beyond you?”"},{"number":38,"verse":"Jonathan called out to the servant, “Hurry! Go faster! Don’t delay!” Jonathan’s servant retrieved the arrow and came back to his master."},{"number":39,"verse":"(Now the servant did not understand any of this. Only Jonathan and David knew what was going on.) (tn Heb “knew the matter.”)"},{"number":40,"verse":"Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the servant who was with him. He said to him, “Go, take these things back to the city.”"},{"number":41,"verse":"When the servant had left, David got up from beside the mound, (tc The translation follows the LXX in reading “the mound,” rather than the MT’s “the south.” It is hard to see what meaning the MT reading “from beside the south” would have as it stands, since such a location lacks specificity. The NIV treats it as an elliptical expression, rendering the phrase as “from the south side of the stone (rock NCV).” This is perhaps possible, but it seems better to follow the LXX rather than the MT here.) knelt (tn Heb “fell.”) with his face to the ground, and bowed three times. Then they kissed each other and they both wept, especially David."},{"number":42,"verse":"Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for the two of us have sworn together in the name of the LORD saying, ‘The LORD will be between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever.’”"}]}
