Bring a charge against me before the LORD and before his chosen king. (tn Heb “anointed [one].”) Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I wronged? Whom have I oppressed?

The translation follows the LXX and the Syriac Peshitta in reading “Barak.”) Jephthah, and Samuel, (tc In the ancient versions there is some confusion with regard to these names, both with regard to the particular names selected for mention and with regard to the order in which they are listed. For example, the LXX has “Jerub-Baal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel.” But the Targum has “Gideon, Samson, Jephthah, and Samuel,” while the Syriac Peshitta has “Deborah, Barak, Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson.”) and he delivered you from the hand of the enemies all around you, and you were able to live securely."},{"number":12,"verse":"“When you saw that King Nahash of the Ammonites was advancing against you, you said to me, ‘No!

McCarter, 1 Samuel (AB), 212.)"},{"number":16,"verse":"“So now, take your positions and watch this great thing that the LORD is about to do in your sight."},{"number":17,"verse":"Is this not the time of the wheat harvest?
