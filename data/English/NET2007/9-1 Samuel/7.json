All the people (tn Heb “house” (also in the following verse).) of Israel longed for (tn Heb “mourned after”; NIV “mourned and sought after”; KJV, NRSV “lamented after”; NAB “turned to”; NCV “began to follow…again.”) the LORD."},{"number":3,"verse":"Samuel said to all the people of Israel, “If you are really turning to the LORD with all your hearts, remove from among you the foreign gods and the images of Ashtoreth. (tn Heb “the Ashtarot” (plural; also in the following verse). The words “images of” are supplied for clarity. sn The Semitic goddess Astarte was associated with love and war in the ancient Near East. The presence of Ashtarot in Israel is a sign of pervasive pagan and idolatrous influences; hence Samuel calls for their removal. See 1 Sam 31:10, where the Philistines deposit the armor of the deceased Saul in the temple of the Ashtarot, and 1 Kgs 11:5, 33; 2 Kgs 23:13, where Solomon is faulted for worshiping the Ashtarot.) Give your hearts to the LORD and serve only him. Then he will deliver you (tn Following imperatives, the jussive verbal form with the prefixed conjunction indicates purpose/result.) from the hand of the Philistines.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"So the Israelites (tn Heb “the sons of Israel.”) removed the Baals and images of Ashtoreth.

When the Israelites heard about this, they were afraid of the Philistines."},{"number":8,"verse":"The Israelites said to Samuel, “Keep (tn Heb “don’t stop.”) crying out to the LORD our (tc The LXX reads “your God” rather than the MT’s “our God.”) God so that he may save us (tn After the negated jussive, the prefixed verbal form with the prefixed conjunction indicates purpose/result.) from the hand of the Philistines!”"},{"number":9,"verse":"So Samuel took a nursing lamb (tn Heb “a lamb of milk”; NAB “an unweaned lamb”; NIV “a suckling lamb”; NCV “a baby lamb.”) and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. Samuel cried out to the LORD on Israel’s behalf, and the LORD answered him."},{"number":10,"verse":"As Samuel was offering burnt offerings, the Philistines approached to do battle with Israel.
