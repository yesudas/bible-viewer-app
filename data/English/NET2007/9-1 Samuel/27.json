There is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of searching for me through all the territory of Israel and I will escape from his hand.”"},{"number":2,"verse":"So David left and crossed over to King Achish son of Maoch of Gath accompanied by his six hundred men."},{"number":3,"verse":"David settled with Achish in Gath, along with his men and their families.

Why should your servant settle in the royal city with you?”"},{"number":6,"verse":"So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day.
