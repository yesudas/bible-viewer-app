After all, you were kind to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt.” So the Kenites withdrew from among the Amalekites."},{"number":7,"verse":"Then Saul struck down the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to (tn Heb “[as] you enter.”) Shur, which is next to Egypt."},{"number":8,"verse":"He captured King Agag of the Amalekites alive, but he executed all Agag’s people (tn Heb “all the people.” For clarity “Agag’s” has been supplied in the translation.) with the sword."},{"number":9,"verse":"However, Saul and the army spared Agag, along with the best of the flock, the cattle, the fatlings, (tn The Hebrew text is difficult here. We should probably read וְהַמַּשְׂמַנִּים (vÿhammasmannim, “the fat ones”) rather than the MT וְהַמִּשְׂנִים (vÿhammisnim, “the second ones”). However, if the MT is retained, the sense may be as the Jewish commentator Kimchi supposed: the second-born young, thought to be better than the firstlings. (For discussion see S. R. Driver, Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel, 123-24.)) and the lambs, as well as everything else that was of value. (tn Heb “good.”) They were not willing to slaughter them. But they did slaughter everything that was despised (tc The MT has here the very odd form נְמִבְזָה (nÿmivzah), but this is apparently due to a scribal error.

But Samuel was informed, “Saul has gone to Carmel where (tn Heb “and look.”) he is setting up a monument for himself. Then Samuel left (tn Heb “and he turned and crossed over.”) and went down to Gilgal.” (tc At the end of v. 12 the LXX and one Old Latin ms include the following words not found in the MT: “to Saul. And behold, he was offering as a burnt offering to the Lord the best of the spoils that he had brought from the Amalekites.”)"},{"number":13,"verse":"When Samuel came to him, (tn Heb “to Saul.”) Saul said to him, “May the LORD bless you!

(tn Heb “as [in] listening to the voice of the Lord.”) Certainly, (tn Heb “look.”) obedience (tn Heb “listening.”) is better than sacrifice; paying attention is better than (tn The expression “is better” is understood here by ellipsis (see the immediately preceding statement).) the fat of rams."},{"number":23,"verse":"For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and presumption is like the evil of idolatry.

When God makes such a decree he will not alter it or change his mind. This does not mean that God never deviates from his stated intentions or changes his mind. On the contrary, several passages describe him as changing his mind. In fact, his willingness to do so is one of his fundamental divine attributes (see Joel 2:13; Jonah 4:2). For a fuller discussion see R. B. Chisholm, Jr., “Does God Change His Mind?” BSac 152 (1995): 387-99.)"},{"number":30,"verse":"Saul (tn Heb “he”; the referent (Saul) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) again replied, “I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel. Go back with me so I may worship the LORD your God.”"},{"number":31,"verse":"So Samuel followed Saul back, and Saul worshiped the LORD."},{"number":32,"verse":"Samuel Puts Agag to Death Then Samuel said, “Bring me King Agag of the Amalekites.” So Agag came to him trembling, (tn The MT reading מַעֲדַנֹּת (ma’adannot, literally, “bonds,” used here adverbially, “in bonds”) is difficult. The word is found only here and in Job 38:31. Part of the problem lies in determining the root of the word. Some scholars have taken it to be from the root ענד (’nd, “to bind around”), but this assumes a metathesis of two of the letters of the root. Others take it from the root עדן (’dn) with the meaning “voluptuously,” but this does not seem to fit the context. It seems better to understand the word to be from the root מעד (m’d, “to totter” or “shake”). In that case it describes the fear that Agag experienced in realizing the mortal danger that he faced as he approached Samuel. This is the way that the LXX translators understood the word, rendering it by the Greek participle τρέμον (tremon, “trembling”).) thinking to himself, (tn Heb “and Agag said.”) “Surely death is bitter!” (tc The text is difficult here. With the LXX, two Old Latin mss, and the Syriac Peshitta it is probably preferable to delete סָר (sar, “is past”) of the MT; it looks suspiciously like a dittograph of the following word מַר (mar, “bitter”). This further affects the interpretation of Agag’s comment. In the MT he comes to Samuel confidently assured that the danger is over (cf. KJV, NASB, NIV “Surely the bitterness of death is past,” along with NLT, CEV). However, it seems more likely that Agag realized that his fortunes had suddenly taken a turn for the worse and that the clemency he had enjoyed from Saul would not be his lot from Samuel. The present translation thus understands Agag to approach not confidently but in the stark realization that his death is imminent (“Surely death is bitter!”). Cf. NAB “So it is bitter death!”; NRSV “Surely this is the bitterness of death”; TEV “What a bitter thing it is to die!”)"},{"number":33,"verse":"Samuel said, “Just as your sword left women childless, so your mother will be the most bereaved among women!” Then Samuel hacked Agag to pieces there in Gilgal before the LORD."},{"number":34,"verse":"Then Samuel went to Ramah, while Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul."},{"number":35,"verse":"Until the day he (tn That is, Samuel.) died Samuel did not see Saul again. Samuel did, however, mourn for Saul, but the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel."}]}
