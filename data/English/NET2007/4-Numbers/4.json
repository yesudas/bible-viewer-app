Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:"},{"number":2,"verse":"“Take a census (tn Heb “lift up the head.” The form נָשֹׂא (naso’) is the Qal infinitive absolute functioning here as a pure verb form. This serves to emphasize the basic verbal root idea (see GKC 346 §113. bb). sn The census of chapter 3 was to register all male Levites from a month old and up. It arranged the general duties of each of the tribes. The second census of Levites now will focus on those between 30 and 50 years of age, those who were actually in service. These are the working Levites. The duties here will be more specific for each of the families. The Kohathites, although part of the ordinary ministry of Levites, were a special group chosen to handle the most holy furnishings. J. Milgrom shows three aspects of their service: (1) skilled labor (מְלָאכָה, mÿla’khah) or “work,” (2) physical labor (עֲבֹדָה, ‘avodah) or “service,” and (3) assisting the priests (שָׁרֵת, sharet) or “ministering” (see his Studies in Levitical Terminology, 1:60-70).) of the Kohathites from among the Levites, by their families and by their clans,"},{"number":3,"verse":"from thirty years old and upward to fifty years old, all who enter the company (tn The word “company” is literally “host, army” (צָבָא, tsava’).

(tn The Hebrew text simply has “the holy of holies,” or “the holy of the holy things” (קֹדֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִׁים, qodesh haqqodashim). The context indicates that this refers to all the sacred furnishings.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"When it is time for the camp to journey, (tn The Hebrew text uses the infinitive construct in an adverbial clause of time; literally it says “in the journeying of the camp.” The genitive in such constructions is usually the subject. Here the implication is that people would be preparing to transport the camp and its equipment.) Aaron and his sons must come and take down the screening curtain and cover the ark of the testimony with it."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then they must put over it a covering of fine leather (tn The exact meaning of the Hebrew word here is difficult to determine. The term תַּחַשׁ (takhash) has been translated “badgers’ [skins]” by KJV. ASV has “sealskin” while RSV uses “goatskin”; NEB and NASB have “porpoise skin,” and NIV has “hides of sea cows.” This is close to “porpoise,” and seems influenced by the Arabic. The evidence is not strong for any of these meanings, and some of the suggestions would be problematic. It is possible the word is simply used for “fine leather,” based on the Egyptian ths. This has been followed by NRSV (“fine leather”) and NLT (“fine goatskin leather”) along with the present translation. See further HALOT 1720-21 s. v. תַּחַשׁ.) and spread over that a cloth entirely of blue, and then they must insert its poles."},{"number":7,"verse":"“On the table of the presence (sn The Hebrew actually has the “table of faces,” and this has been traditionally rendered “table of shewbread.”) they must spread a blue (tn The Greek has “violet” instead of blue.

(tn The “pole” or “bar” (מוֹט, mot) is of a different style than the poles used for transporting the ark. It seems to be a flexible bar carried by two men with the implements being transported tied to the bar. The NEB suggests the items were put in a bag and slung over the bar, but there is no indication of the manner.)"},{"number":11,"verse":"“They must spread a blue cloth on the gold altar, and cover it with a covering of fine leather; and they must insert its poles."},{"number":12,"verse":"Then they must take all the utensils of the service, with which they serve in the sanctuary, put them in a blue cloth, cover them with a covering of fine leather, and put them on a carrying beam."},{"number":13,"verse":"Also, they must take away the ashes from the altar (tc The Greek text has “and he must place the cover upon the altar” instead of “and they must take away the ashes from the altar.” The verb is the Piel form; its nuance seems to be privative, i. e., stating that the object is deprived of the material – the ashes are removed. This is the main altar in the courtyard.) and spread a purple cloth over it."},{"number":14,"verse":"Then they must place on it all its implements with which they serve there — the trays, the meat forks, the shovels, the basins, and all the utensils of the altar — and they must spread on it a covering of fine leather, and then insert its poles.
