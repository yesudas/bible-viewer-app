The first is the rebellion itself (vv. 1–19). The second is the judgment (vv. 20–35). Third is the atonement for the rebels (vv. 36–50). The whole chapter is a marvelous account of a massive rebellion against the leaders that concludes with reconciliation. For further study see G. Hort, “The Death of Qorah,” ABR 7 (1959): 2-26; and J. Liver, “Korah, Dathan and Abiram,” Studies in the Bible (ScrHier 8), 189-217.) Now Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, who were Reubenites, (tc The MT reading is plural (“the sons of Reuben”); the Smr and LXX have the singular (“the son of Reuben”).) took men (tn In the Hebrew text there is no object for the verb “took.” The translation presented above supplies the word “men.” However, it is possible that the MT has suffered damage here. The LXX has “and he spoke.” The Syriac and Targum have “and he was divided.” The editor of BHS suggests that perhaps the MT should be emended to “and he arose.”)"},{"number":2,"verse":"and rebelled against Moses, along with some of the Israelites, 250 leaders (tn Heb “princes” (so KJV, ASV).) of the community, chosen from the assembly, (tn These men must have been counselors or judges of some kind.) famous men. (tn Heb “men of name,” or “men of renown.”)"},{"number":3,"verse":"And they assembled against Moses and Aaron, saying to them, “You take too much upon yourselves, (tn The meaning of רַב־לָכֶם (rab-lakhem) is something like “you have assumed far too much authority.” It simply means “much to you,” perhaps “you have gone to far,” or “you are overreaching yourselves” (M. Noth, Numbers [OTL], 123). He is objecting to the exclusiveness of the system that Moses has been introducing.) seeing that the whole community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the community of the LORD?”"},{"number":4,"verse":"When Moses heard it he fell down with his face to the ground. (tn Heb “fell on his face.”)"},{"number":5,"verse":"Then he said to Korah and to all his company, “In the morning the LORD will make known who are his, and who is holy. He will cause that person (tn Heb “him.”) to approach him; the person he has chosen he will cause to approach him."},{"number":6,"verse":"Do this, Korah, you and all your company: (tn Heb “his congregation” or “his community.” The expression is unusual, but what it signifies is that Korah had set up a rival “Israel” with himself as leader.)

You take too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi!”"},{"number":8,"verse":"Moses said to Korah, “Listen now, you sons of Levi!"},{"number":9,"verse":"Does it seem too small a thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the community of Israel to bring you near to himself, to perform the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the community to minister to them?"},{"number":10,"verse":"He has brought you near and all your brothers, the sons of Levi, with you. Do you now seek (tn The verb is the Piel perfect. There is no imperfect tense before this, which makes the construction a little difficult. If the vav (ו) is classified as a consecutive, then the form would stand alone as an equivalent to the imperfect, and rendered as a modal nuance such as “would you [now] seek,” or as a progressive imperfect, “are you seeking.” This latter nuance can be obtained by treating it as a regular perfect tense, with an instantaneous nuance: “do you [now] seek.”sn Moses discerned correctly the real motivation for the rebellion. Korah wanted to be the high priest because he saw how much power there was in the spiritual leadership in Israel. He wanted something like a general election with himself as the candidate and his supporters promoting him. The great privilege of being a Levite and serving in the sanctuary was not enough for him – the status did not satisfy him. Korah gave no rebuttal. The test would be one of ministering with incense. This would bring them into direct proximity with the Lord. If God honored Korah as a ministering priest, then it would be settled. But Moses accuses them of rebellion against the Lord, because the Lord had chosen Aaron to be the priest.) the priesthood also?"},{"number":11,"verse":"Therefore you and all your company have assembled together against the LORD! And Aaron — what is he that you murmur against him?” (sn The question indicates that they had been murmuring against Aaron, that is, expressing disloyalty and challenging his leadership. But it is actually against the Lord that they had been murmuring because the Lord had put Aaron in that position.)"},{"number":12,"verse":"Then Moses summoned (tn Heb “Moses sent to summon.” The verb קָרָא (qara’) followed by the lamed (ל) preposition does not mean “call to” but “summon.” This is a command performance; for them to appear would be to submit to Moses’ authority. This they will not do.) Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come up. (tn The imperfect tense נַעֲלֶה (na’aleh) expresses their unwillingness to report: “we are not willing,” or “we will not.” The verb means “to go up.” It is used in the sense of appearing before an authority or a superior (see, e. g., Gen 46:31; Deut 25:7; Judg 4:5).)"},{"number":13,"verse":"Is it a small thing (tn The question is rhetorical. It was not a small thing to them – it was a big thing.) that you have brought us up out of the land that flows with milk and honey, (tn The modern scholar who merely sees these words as belonging to an earlier tradition about going up to the land of Canaan that flows with milk and honey misses the irony here. What is happening is that the text is showing how twisted the thinking of the rebels is. They have turned things completely around. Egypt was the land flowing with milk and honey, not Canaan where they will die. The words of rebellion are seldom original, and always twisted.) to kill us in the wilderness? Now do you want to make yourself a prince (tn The verb הִשְׂתָּרֵר (histarer) is the Hitpael infinitive absolute that emphasizes the preceding תִשְׂתָּרֵר (tistarer), the Hitpael imperfect tense (both forms having metathesis). The verb means “to rule; to act like a prince; to make oneself a prince.” This is the only occurrence of the reflexive for this verb. The exact nuance is difficult to translate into English. But they are accusing Moses of seizing princely power for himself, perhaps making a sarcastic reference to his former status in Egypt. The rebels here are telling Moses that they had discerned his scheme, and so he could not “hoodwink” them (cf. NEB).) over us?"},{"number":14,"verse":"Moreover, (tn Here אַף (’af) has the sense of “in addition.” It is not a common use.) you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you think you can blind (tn Heb “will you bore out the eyes of these men?” The question is “Will you continue to mislead them?” (or “hoodwink” them). In Deut 16:19 it is used for taking a bribe; something like that kind of deception is intended here. They are simply stating that Moses is a deceiver who is misleading the people with false promises.) these men? We will not come up.”"},{"number":15,"verse":"Moses was very angry, and he said to the LORD, “Have no respect (tn The verb means “to turn toward”; it is a figurative expression that means “to pay attention to” or “to have regard for.” So this is a prayer against Dathan and Abiram.) for their offering! I have not taken so much as one donkey from them, nor have I harmed any one of them!”"},{"number":16,"verse":"Then Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company present yourselves before the LORD — you and they, and Aaron — tomorrow."},{"number":17,"verse":"And each of you (tn Heb “and take, a man, his censer.”) take his censer, put (tn This verb and the following one are both perfect tenses with vav (ו) consecutives.

They are an assembly of rebels, their “community” consisting in their common plot.) that I may consume them in an instant.”"},{"number":22,"verse":"Then they threw themselves down with their faces to the ground (sn It is Moses and Aaron who prostrate themselves; they have the good of the people at heart.) and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all people, (tn The expression “the God of the spirits of all humanity [flesh]” is somewhat difficult. The Hebrew text says אֱלֹהֵי הָרוּחֹת לְכָל־בָּשָׂר (’elohey harukhot lÿkhol-basar). This expression occurs in Num 27:16 again. It also occurs in some postbiblical texts, a fact which has prompted some scholars to conclude that it is a late addition. The words clearly show that Moses is interceding for the congregation. The appeal in the verse is that it is better for one man to die for the whole nation than the whole nation for one man (see also John 11:50).) will you be angry with the whole community when only one man sins?” (tn The verb is the Qal imperfect יֶחֱטָא (yekheta’); it refers to the sinful rebellion of Korah, but Moses is stating something of a principle: “One man sins, and will you be angry….” A past tense translation would assume that this is a preterite use of the imperfect (without vav [ו] consecutive).)"},{"number":23,"verse":"So the LORD spoke to Moses:"},{"number":24,"verse":"“Tell the community: ‘Get away (tn The motif of “going up” is still present; here the Hebrew text says “go up” (the Niphal imperative – “go up yourselves”) from their tents, meaning, move away from them.) from around the homes of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’”"},{"number":25,"verse":"Then Moses got up (tn Heb “rose up.”) and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel went after him."},{"number":26,"verse":"And he said to the community, “Move away from the tents of these wicked (tn The word רָשָׁע (rasha’) has the sense of a guilty criminal.

The idea of “wickedness” therefore applies in that sense.) men, and do not touch anything they have, lest you be destroyed because (tn The preposition bet (בְּ) in this line is causal – “on account of their sins.”) of all their sins.” (sn The impression is that the people did not hear what the Lord said to Moses, but only what Moses said to the people as a result. They saw the brilliant cloud, and perhaps heard the sound of his voice, but the relaying of the instructions indicates they did not hear the actual instruction from the Lord himself.)"},{"number":27,"verse":"So they got away from the homes of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram on every side, and Dathan and Abiram came out and stationed themselves (tn The verb נִצָּבִים (nitsavim) suggests a defiant stance, for the word is often used in the sense of taking a stand for or against something. It can also be somewhat neutral, having the sense of positioning oneself for a purpose.) in the entrances of their tents with their wives, their children, and their toddlers."},{"number":28,"verse":"Then Moses said, “This is how (tn Heb “in this.”) you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them of my own will.

Wolff, Anthropology of the Old Testament).

The usage here is certainly the first, and very likely the second as well. A translation of “pit” would not be inappropriate. Since they will go down there alive, it is likely that they will sense the deprivation and the separation from the land above. See H. W. Robinson, Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament; N.
