It is hard to determine how long they were in Transjordan, but a good amount of time must have elapsed for the number of moves they made and the wars they fought. There is a considerable amount of information available on this section of the book. Some of the most helpful works include: H. C. Brichto, The Problem of “Curse” in the Hebrew Bible (JBLMS); E. Burrows, The Oracles of Jacob and Balaam; G. W. Coats, “Balaam, Sinner or Saint?” BR 18 (1973): 21-29; P. C. Craigie, “The Conquest and Early Hebrew Poetry,” TynBul 20 (1969): 76-94; I. Parker, “The Way of God and the Way of Balaam,” ExpTim 17 (1905): 45; and J. A. Wharton, “The Command to Bless: An Exposition of Numbers 22:41–23:25,” Int 13 (1959): 37-48. This first part introduces the characters and sets the stage for the oracles. It can be divided into four sections: the invitation declined (vv. 1–14), the second invitation extended (vv. 15–21), God opposes Balaam (vv. 22–35), and Balaam meets Balak (vv. 36–41).) The Israelites traveled on (tn The verse begins with the vav (ו) consecutive.) and camped in the plains of Moab on the side of the Jordan River (tn The word “River” is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for clarity.) across from Jericho.

B. Huffmon, “Prophecy in the Mari Letters,” BA 31 [1968]: 101-24).
