The people wept loudly. (tn Heb “with much weeping.”)"},{"number":2,"verse":"Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, from the descendants of Elam, (tc The translation reads with the Qere, many medieval Hebrew MSS, the LXX, the Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate עֵילָם (’elam, “Elam”) rather than the reading עוֹלָם (’olam, “eternity”) found in the MT.) addressed Ezra: “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying (tn Heb “in that we have given a dwelling to.” So also in vv. 14, 17, 18.) foreign women from the local peoples. (tn Heb “the peoples of the lands.”) Nonetheless, there is still hope for Israel in this regard. (tn Heb “upon this.”)"},{"number":3,"verse":"Therefore let us enact (tn Heb “cut.”) a covenant with our God to send away all these women and their offspring, in keeping with your counsel, my lord, (tn The MT vocalizes this word as a plural, which could be understood as a reference to God. But the context seems to suggest that a human lord is intended. The apparatus of BHS suggests repointing the word as a singular (“my lord”), but this is unnecessary. The plural (“my lords”) can be understood in an honorific sense even when a human being is in view. Most English versions regard this as a reference to Ezra, so the present translation supplies “your” before “counsel” to make this clear.) and that of those who respect (tn Heb “who tremble at”; NAB, NIV “who fear.”) the commandments of our God. And let it be done according to the law."},{"number":4,"verse":"Get up, for this matter concerns you. We are with you, so be strong and act decisively!”"},{"number":5,"verse":"So Ezra got up and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take an oath to carry out this plan. (tn Heb “to do according to this plan.”) And they all took a solemn oath."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then Ezra got up from in front of the temple of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he stayed (tc The translation reads וַיָּלֶן (vayyalen, “and he stayed”) rather than the reading וַיֵּלֶךְ (vayyelekh, “and he went”) of the MT. Cf. the LXX.) there, he did not eat food or drink water, for he was in mourning over the infidelity of the exiles."},{"number":7,"verse":"A proclamation (tn Heb “voice.”) was circulated (tn Heb “they sent.”) throughout Judah and Jerusalem (map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) that all the exiles were to be assembled in Jerusalem."},{"number":8,"verse":"Everyone who did not come within three days would thereby forfeit all his property, in keeping with the counsel of the officials and the elders. Furthermore, he himself would be excluded from the assembly of the exiles."},{"number":9,"verse":"All the men of Judah and Benjamin were gathered in Jerusalem within the three days.
