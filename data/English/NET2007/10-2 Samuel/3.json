His fifth son was Shephatiah, the son of Abitail."},{"number":5,"verse":"His sixth son was Ithream, born to David’s wife Eglah. These sons (tn The Hebrew text does not have “sons.”) were all born to David in Hebron."},{"number":6,"verse":"Abner Defects to David’s Camp As the war continued between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was becoming more influential (tn Heb “was strengthening himself.” The statement may have a negative sense here, perhaps suggesting that Abner was overstepping the bounds of political propriety in a self-serving way.) in the house of Saul."},{"number":7,"verse":"Now Saul had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. Ish-bosheth (tc The Hebrew of the MT reads simply “and he said,” with no expressed subject for the verb. It is not likely that the text originally had no expressed subject for this verb, since the antecedent is not immediately clear from the context. We should probably restore to the Hebrew text the name “Ish-bosheth.” See a few medieval Hebrew mss, Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, and Vulgate. Perhaps the name was accidentally omitted by homoioarcton. Note that both the name Ishbosheth and the following preposition אֶל (’el) begin with the letter alef.) said to Abner, “Why did you have sexual relations with (tn Heb “come to”; KJV, NRSV “gone in to”; NAB “been intimate with”; NIV “sleep with.”) my father’s concubine?” (sn This accusation against Abner is a very serious one, since an act of sexual infringement on the king’s harem would probably have been understood as a blatant declaration of aspirations to kingship. As such it was not merely a matter of ethical impropriety but an act of grave political significance as well.)"},{"number":8,"verse":"These words of Ish-bosheth really angered Abner and he said, “Am I the head of a dog that belongs to Judah? This very day I am demonstrating (tn Heb “I do.”) loyalty to the house of Saul your father and to his relatives (tn Heb “brothers.”) and his friends! I have not betrayed you into the hand of David. Yet you have accused me of sinning with this woman today! (tn Heb “and you have laid upon me the guilt of the woman today.”)"},{"number":9,"verse":"God will severely judge Abner (tn Heb “So will God do to Abner and so he will add to him.”) if I do not do for David exactly what the LORD has promised him, (tc Heb “has sworn to David.” The LXX, with the exception of the recension of Origen, adds “in this day.”)"},{"number":10,"verse":"namely, to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah all the way from Dan to Beer Sheba!”"},{"number":11,"verse":"Ish-bosheth (tn Heb “he”; the referent (Ish-bosheth) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) was unable to answer Abner with even a single word because he was afraid of him."},{"number":12,"verse":"Then Abner sent messengers (tn The Hebrew text adds here, “on his behalf.”) to David saying, “To whom does the land belong?

I will make an agreement with you. I ask only one thing from you. You will not see my face unless you bring Saul’s daughter Michal when you come to visit me.” (tn The words “when you come to see my face,” though found in the Hebrew text, are somewhat redundant given the similar expression in the earlier part of the verse. The words are absent from the Syriac Peshitta.)"},{"number":14,"verse":"David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth son of Saul with this demand: (tn Heb “to Ish-bosheth son of Saul saying.” To avoid excessive sibilance (especially when read aloud) the translation renders “saying” as “with this demand.”) “Give me my wife Michal whom I acquired (tn Heb “whom I betrothed to myself.”) for a hundred Philistine foreskins.”"},{"number":15,"verse":"So Ish-bosheth took her (tn Heb “sent and took her.”) from her husband Paltiel (tn In 1 Sam 25:44 this name appears as “Palti.”) son of Laish."},{"number":16,"verse":"Her husband went along behind her, weeping all the way to Bahurim. Finally Abner said to him, “Go back!” (tn Heb “Go, return.”) So he returned home."},{"number":17,"verse":"Abner advised (tn Heb “the word of Abner was with.”) the elders of Israel, “Previously you were wanting David to be your king. (tn Heb “you were seeking David to be king over you.”)"},{"number":18,"verse":"Act now! For the LORD has said to David, ‘By the hand of my servant David I will save (tc The present translation follows the LXX, the Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate in reading “I will save,” rather than the MT “he saved.” The context calls for the 1st person common singular imperfect of the verb rather than the 3rd person masculine singular perfect.) my people Israel from (tn Heb “from the hand of.”) the Philistines and from all their enemies.’”"},{"number":19,"verse":"Then Abner spoke privately (tn Heb “into the ears of.”) with the Benjaminites. Abner also went to Hebron to inform David privately (tn Heb “also Abner went to speak into the ears of David in Hebron.”) of all that Israel and the entire house of Benjamin had agreed to.

Surely he came here to spy on you and to determine when you leave and when you return (tn Heb “your going out and your coming in.” The expression is a merism. It specifically mentions the polar extremities of the actions but includes all activity in between the extremities as well, thus encompassing the entirety of one’s activities.) and to discover everything that you are doing!”"},{"number":26,"verse":"Then Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well of Sirah. (But David was not aware of it.)"},{"number":27,"verse":"When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate as if to speak privately with him. Joab then stabbed him (tn Heb “and he struck him down there [in] the stomach.”) in the abdomen and killed him, avenging the shed blood of his brother Asahel.

The most likely subject is Abner’s “shed blood” (v. 28), which is a masculine plural form in Hebrew. The verb חוּל (khul, “whirl”) is used with the preposition עַל (’al) only here and in Jer 23:19; 30:23.) the head of Joab and the entire house of his father! (tc 4QSama has “of Joab” rather than “of his father” read by the MT.) May the males of Joab’s house (tn Heb “the house of Joab.” However, it is necessary to specify that David’s curse is aimed at Joab’s male descendants; otherwise it would not be clear that “one who works at the spindle” refers to a man doing woman’s work rather than a woman.) never cease to have (tn Heb “and may there not be cut off from the house of Joab.”) someone with a running sore or a skin disease or one who works at the spindle (tn The expression used here is difficult. The translation “one who works at the spindle” follows a suggestion of S. R. Driver that the expression pejoratively describes an effeminate man who, rather than being a mighty warrior, is occupied with tasks that are normally fulfilled by women (S. R. Driver, Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel, 250-51; cf. NAB “one unmanly”; TEV “fit only to do a woman’s work”; CEV “cowards”). But P. K. McCarter, following an alleged Phoenician usage of the noun to refer to “crutches,” adopts a different view. He translates the phrase “clings to a crutch,” seeing here a further description of physical lameness (II Samuel [AB], 118). Such an idea fits the present context well and is followed by NIV, NCV, and NLT, although the evidence for this meaning is questionable. According to DNWSI 2:915-16, the noun consistently refers to a spindle in Phoenician, as it does in Ugaritic (see UT 468).) or one who falls by the sword or one who lacks food!”"},{"number":30,"verse":"So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel in Gibeon during the battle."},{"number":31,"verse":"David instructed Joab and all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes! Put on sackcloth! Lament before Abner!” Now King David followed (tn Heb “was walking.”) behind the funeral bier."},{"number":32,"verse":"So they buried Abner in Hebron.
