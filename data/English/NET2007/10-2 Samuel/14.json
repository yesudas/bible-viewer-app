Absalom."},{"number":2,"verse":"So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman. He told her, “Pretend to be in mourning (tn The Hebrew Hitpael verbal form here indicates pretended rather than genuine action.) and put on garments for mourning. Don’t anoint yourself with oil. Instead, act like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for some time. (tn Heb “these many days.”)"},{"number":3,"verse":"Go to the king and speak to him in the following fashion.” Then Joab told her what to say. (tn Heb “put the words in her mouth” (so NASB, NIV).)"},{"number":4,"verse":"So the Tekoan woman went (tc The translation follows many medieval Hebrew mss in reading וַתַּבֹא (vattavo’, “and she went”) rather than the MT וַתֹּאמֶר (vatto’mer, “and she said”). The MT reading shows confusion with וַתֹּאמֶר later in the verse. The emendation suggested here is supported by the LXX, the Syriac Peshitta, some mss of the Targum, and Vulgate.) to the king. She bowed down with her face to the ground in deference to him and said, “Please help me, (tn The word “me” is left to be inferred in the Hebrew text; it is present in the Syriac Peshitta and Vulgate.) O king!”"},{"number":5,"verse":"The king replied to her, “What do you want?” (tn Heb “What to you?”) She answered, “I am a widow; my husband is dead."},{"number":6,"verse":"Your servant (tn Here and elsewhere (vv. 7, 12, 15a, 17, 19) the woman uses a term which suggests a lower level female servant. She uses the term to express her humility before the king. However, she uses a different term in vv. 15b–16. See the note at v. 15 for a discussion of the rhetorical purpose of this switch in terminology.) has two sons. When the two of them got into a fight in the field, there was no one present who could intervene. One of them struck the other and killed him."},{"number":7,"verse":"Now the entire family has risen up against your servant, saying, ‘Turn over the one who struck down his brother, so that we can execute him and avenge the death (tn Heb “in exchange for the life.” The Hebrew preposition בְּ (bÿ, “in”) here is the so-called bet pretii, or bet (בְּ) of price, defining the value attached to someone or something.) of his brother whom he killed. In so doing we will also destroy the heir.’ They want to extinguish my remaining coal, (sn My remaining coal is here metaphorical language, describing the one remaining son as her only source of lingering hope for continuing the family line.) leaving no one on the face of the earth to carry on the name of my husband.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"Then the king told the woman, “Go to your home. I will give instructions concerning your situation.” (tn Heb “concerning you.”)"},{"number":9,"verse":"The Tekoan woman said to the king, “My lord the king, let any blame fall on me and on the house of my father.

(tc The LXX (ὄψεταί με, opsetai me) has misunderstood the Hebrew יֵרְאֻנִי (yerÿ’uni, Piel perfect, “they have made me fearful”), taking the verb to be a form of the verb רָאָה (ra’ah, “to see”) rather than the verb יָרֵא (yare’, “to fear”). The fact that the Greek translators were working with an unvocalized Hebrew text (i. e., consonants only) made them very susceptible to this type of error.) But your servant said, ‘I will speak to the king!
