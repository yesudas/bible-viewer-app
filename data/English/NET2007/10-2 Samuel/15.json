(tn Heb “to run ahead of him.”)"},{"number":2,"verse":"Now Absalom used to get up early and stand beside the road that led to the city gate. Whenever anyone came by who had a complaint to bring to the king for arbitration, Absalom would call out to him, “What city are you from?” The person would answer, “I, your servant, (tn Heb “your servant.” So also in vv. 8, 15, 21.) am from one of the tribes of Israel.”"},{"number":3,"verse":"Absalom would then say to him, “Look, your claims are legitimate and appropriate. (tn Heb “good and straight.”) But there is no representative of the king who will listen to you.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"Absalom would then say, “If only they would make me (tn Heb “Who will make me?”) a judge in the land! Then everyone who had a judicial complaint (tn Heb “a complaint and a judgment.” The expression is a hendiadys.) could come to me and I would make sure he receives a just settlement.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"When someone approached to bow before him, Absalom (tn Heb “he”; the referent (Absalom) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) would extend his hand and embrace him and kiss him."},{"number":6,"verse":"Absalom acted this way toward everyone in Israel who came to the king for justice. In this way Absalom won the loyalty (tn Heb “stole the heart.”) of the citizens (tn Heb “the men.”) of Israel."},{"number":7,"verse":"After four (tc The MT has here “forty,” but this is presumably a scribal error for “four.” The context will not tolerate a period of forty years prior to the rebellion of Absalom. The Lucianic Greek recension (τέσσαρα ἔτη, tessara ete), the Syriac Peshitta (’arba’ sanin), and Vulgate (post quattuor autem annos) in fact have the expected reading “four years.” Most English translations follow the versions in reading “four” here, although some (e. g. KJV, ASV, NASB, NKJV), following the MT, read “forty.”) years Absalom said to the king, “Let me go and repay my vow that I made to the LORD while I was in Hebron."},{"number":8,"verse":"For I made this vow (tn Heb “for your servant vowed a vow.” The formal court style of referring to one’s self in third person (“your servant”) has been translated here as first person for clarity.) when I was living in Geshur in Aram: ‘If the LORD really does allow me to return to Jerusalem, (map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.)

It could just as well be taken as a question: “Don’t you see what is happening?” The present translation takes the word as a question, with the implication that Zadok is a priest and not a prophet (i. e., “seer”) and therefore unable to know what the future holds.) Go back to the city in peace! Your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan may go with you and Abiathar.

As Driver points out, the Hebrew verb הִגִּיד (higgid, “he related”) never uses the accusative for the person to whom something is told (S. R. Driver, Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel, 316).) had been told, “Ahithophel has sided with the conspirators who are with Absalom.
