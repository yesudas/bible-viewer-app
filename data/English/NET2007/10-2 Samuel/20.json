Cf. 1 Sam 9:1.) happened to be there. He blew the trumpet (tn Heb “the shophar” (the ram’s horn trumpet). So also v. 22.) and said, “We have no share in David; we have no inheritance in this son of Jesse! Every man go home, (tc The MT reads לְאֹהָלָיו (lÿ’ohalav, “to his tents”). For a similar idiom, see 19:9. An ancient scribal tradition understands the reading to be לְאלֹהָיו (le’lohav, “to his gods”). The word is a tiqqun sopherim, and the scribes indicate that they changed the word from “gods” to “tents” so as to soften its theological implications. In a consonantal Hebrew text the change involved only the metathesis of two letters.) O Israel!”"},{"number":2,"verse":"So all the men of Israel deserted (tn Heb “went up from after.”) David and followed Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stuck by their king all the way from the Jordan River (tn The word “River” is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for clarity.) to Jerusalem.

The king took the ten concubines he had left to care for the palace and placed them under confinement. (tn Heb “and he placed them in a guarded house.”) Though he provided for their needs, he did not have sexual relations with them. (tn Heb “he did not come to them”; NAB “has no further relations with them”; NIV “did not lie with them”; TEV “did not have intercourse with them”; NLT “would no longer sleep with them.”) They remained in confinement until the day they died, living out the rest of their lives as widows."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then the king said to Amasa, “Call the men of Judah together for me in three days, (tn The present translation follows the Masoretic accentuation, with the major mark of disjunction (i. e., the atnach) placed at the word “days.” However, some scholars have suggested moving the atnach to “Judah” a couple of words earlier. This would yield the following sense: “Three days, and you be present here with them.” The difference in meaning is slight, and the MT is acceptable as it stands.) and you be present here with them too.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"So Amasa went out to call Judah together.

Take your lord’s servants and pursue him. Otherwise he will secure (tn Heb “find.” The perfect verbal form is unexpected with the preceding word “otherwise.” We should probably read instead the imperfect. Although it is possible to understand the perfect here as indicating that the feared result is thought of as already having taken place (cf. BDB 814 s. v. פֶּן 2), it is more likely that the perfect is simply the result of scribal error.

Now Joab was dressed in military attire and had a dagger in its sheath belted to his waist. When he advanced, it fell out. (sn The significance of the statement it fell out here is unclear. If the dagger fell out of its sheath before Joab got to Amasa, how then did he kill him? Josephus, Ant. 7.11.7 (7.284), suggested that as Joab approached Amasa he deliberately caused the dagger to fall to the ground at an opportune moment as though by accident. When he bent over and picked it up, he then stabbed Amasa with it. Others have tried to make a case for thinking that two swords are referred to – the one that fell out and another that Joab kept concealed until the last moment. But nothing in the text clearly supports this view. Perhaps Josephus’ understanding is best, but it is by no means obvious in the text either.)"},{"number":9,"verse":"Joab said to Amasa, “How are you, my brother?” With his right hand Joab took hold of Amasa’s beard as if to greet him with a kiss."},{"number":10,"verse":"Amasa did not protect himself from the knife in Joab’s other hand, and Joab (tn Heb “he”; the referent (Joab) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) stabbed him in the abdomen, causing Amasa’s (tn Heb “his”; the referent (Amasa) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) intestines to spill out on the ground.
