(tn Heb “you were the one leading out and the one leading in Israel.”) The LORD said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel; you will rule over Israel.’”"},{"number":3,"verse":"When all the leaders (tn Heb “elders.”) of Israel came to the king at Hebron, King David made an agreement with them (tn Heb “and the king, David, cut for them a covenant.”) in Hebron before the LORD. They designated (tn Heb “anointed.”) David as king over Israel."},{"number":4,"verse":"David was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned for forty years."},{"number":5,"verse":"In Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem (map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) he reigned for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah."},{"number":6,"verse":"(David Occupies Jerusalem) Then the king and his men advanced to Jerusalem (map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) against the Jebusites who lived in the land. The Jebusites (tn The Hebrew text has “he” rather than “the Jebusites.” The referent has been specified in the translation for clarity. In the Syriac Peshitta and some mss of the Targum the verb is plural rather than singular.) said to David, “You cannot invade this place! Even the blind and the lame will turn you back, saying, ‘David cannot invade this place!’”"},{"number":7,"verse":"But David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the city of David)."},{"number":8,"verse":"David said on that day, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites must approach the ‘lame’ and the ‘blind’ who are David’s enemies (tc There is some confusion among the witnesses concerning this word. The Kethib is the Qal perfect 3cp שָׂנְאוּ (sanÿ’u, “they hated”), referring to the Jebusites’ attitude toward David. The Qere is the Qal passive participle construct plural שְׂנֻאֵי (sÿnu’e, “hated”), referring to David’s attitude toward the Jebusites. 4QSama has the Qal perfect 3rd person feminine singular שָׂנְאָה (sanÿ’ah, “hated”), the subject of which would be “the soul of David.” The difference is minor and the translation adopted above works for either the Kethib or the Qere.) by going through the water tunnel.” (tn The meaning of the Hebrew term has been debated. For a survey of various views, see P. K. McCarter, II Samuel (AB), 139-40. sn If a water tunnel is in view here, it is probably the so-called Warren’s Shaft that extends up from Hezekiah’s tunnel. It would have provided a means for surprise attack against the occupants of the city of David. The LXX seems not to understand the reference here, translating “by the water shaft” as “with a small knife.”) For this reason it is said, “The blind and the lame cannot enter the palace.” (tn Heb “the house.” TEV takes this as a reference to the temple (“the Lord’s house”).)"},{"number":9,"verse":"So David lived in the fortress and called it the City of David.
