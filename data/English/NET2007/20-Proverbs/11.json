The first is the perfect tense of בּוֹא (bo’, “to enter; to come”); it is followed by the preterite with vav consecutive from the same verb, showing that one follows or comes with the other.

The proud will be brought down.) but with humility (tn Heb “modesty”; KJV, ASV “the lowly.” The adjective צְנוּעִים (tsÿnu’im, “modest”) is used as a noun; this is an example of antimeria in which one part of speech is used in the place of another (see E. W. Bullinger, Figures of Speech, 491-506), e. g., “Let the dry [adjective] appear!” = dry land (Gen 1:9). The root צָנַע (tsana’, “to be modest; to be humble”) describes those who are reserved, retiring, modest.

Any hope for long life and success borne of wickedness will be disappointed.) and the hope of his strength (tc There are several suggested changes for this word אוֹנִים (’onim, “vigor” or “strength”). Rashi, a Jewish scholar who lived a. d. 1040-1105, suggests that the word refers to children, a meaning implied from Gen 49:3. This would mean that even his children would not benefit from his wickedness. Tg. Prov 11:7 rendered it “who practice crookedness,” deriving it from the first root which means “wickedness.”) perishes.

This one is a false flatterer.) destroys (sn The verb שָׁחַת (shakhat) means “to destroy; to ruin” (e. g., the destruction of Sodom in Gen 13:10).

Wicked leaders, in particular, can bring destruction on a city by their evil counsel.)"},{"number":12,"verse":"The one who denounces (tn Heb “despises” (so NASB) or “belittles” (so NRSV). The participle בָּז (baz, from בּוּז, buz) means “to despise; to show contempt for” someone. It reflects an attitude of pride and judgmentalism. In view of the parallel line, in this situation it would reflect perhaps some public denunciation of another person. sn According to Proverbs (and the Bible as a whole) how one treats a neighbor is an important part of righteousness. One was expected to be a good neighbor, and to protect and safeguard the life and reputation of a neighbor.) his neighbor lacks wisdom, (tn Heb “heart.” The noun לֵב (lev, “heart”) functions as a metonymy of association for wisdom, since the heart is often associated with knowledge and wisdom (BDB 524 s. v. 3. a).) but the one who has discernment (tn Heb “a man of discernment.”) keeps silent. (sn The verb translated “keeps silence” (יַחֲרִישׁ, yakharish) means “holds his peace.” Rather than publicly denouncing another person’s mistake or folly, a wise person will keep quiet about it (e. g., 1 Sam 10:27). A discerning person realizes that the neighbor may become an opponent and someday retaliate.)"},{"number":13,"verse":"The one who goes about slandering others (tn Heb “going about in slander.” This expression refers to a slanderer.

The third participle בּוֹטֵחַ (boteakh, “is secure”) functions verbally.) shaking hands (tn Heb “striking.” The imagery here is shaking hands to seal a contract. The term “hands” does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied.) will be secure."},{"number":16,"verse":"A generous woman (tn Heb “a woman of grace.” The genitive חֵן (khen, “grace”) functions as an attributive adjective.

(tn Heb “brings trouble to his flesh.”sn There may be a conscious effort by the sage to contrast “soul” and “body”: He contrasts the benefits of kindness for the “soul” (translated “himself”) with the trouble that comes to the “flesh/body” (translated “himself”) of the cruel.)"},{"number":18,"verse":"The wicked person (tn The form is the masculine singular adjective used as a substantive.) earns (tn Heb “makes” (so NAB).) deceitful wages, (tn Heb “wages of deception.”sn Whatever recompense or reward the wicked receive will not last, hence, it is deceptive (R.

I כֵּן 2. b). One medieval Hebrew ms, LXX, and Syriac read בֵּן (ben), “son of righteousness.” That idiom, however, usually introduces bad qualities (“son of worthlessness”). Others interpret it as “righteousness is the foundation of life.” KB identifies the form as a participle and reads it as “steadfast in righteousness”; but the verb does not otherwise exist in the Qal. W.

(sn The noun means “goodwill, favor, acceptance, will”; it is related to the verb רָצַה (ratsah) which means “to be pleased with; to accept favorably.” These words are used frequently in scripture to describe what pleases the Lord, meaning, what he accepts. In particular, sacrifices offered properly find acceptance with God (Ps 51:19).

Niph). The phrase “will not go unpunished” (cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV) is an example of tapeinosis (a negative statement that emphasizes the positive opposite statement): “will certainly be punished” (cf. TEV, CEV, NLT).) but the descendants of the righteous (tn Heb “the seed of the righteous.” This is an idiom that describes a class of people who share the nature of righteousness (e. g., Isa 1:4; 65:23).

(tn Heb “taste.” The term can refer to physical taste (Exod 16:31), intellectual discretion (1 Sam 25:33), or ethical judgment (Ps 119:66).

CEV “troublemakers hope to stir up trouble”).) only to good, but what the wicked hope for (tn Heb “the hope of the wicked.” The noun תִּקְוַת (tiqvat) “expectation” functions as an objective genitive: “what the wicked hope for.”) leads (tn The term “leads” does not appear in the Hebrew text in this line but is implied by the parallelism.
