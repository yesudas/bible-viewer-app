Listen, children, (tn Heb “sons.”) to a father’s instruction, (tn Heb “discipline.”) and pay attention so that (tn The Qal infinitive construct with preposition ל (lamed) indicates the purpose/result of the preceding imperative.) you may gain (tn Heb “know” (so KJV, ASV).) discernment."},{"number":2,"verse":"Because I give (tn The perfect tense has the nuance of instantaneous perfect; the sage is now calling the disciples to listen.

The MT makes good sense and requires no emendation. tn Heb “tender and only one.” The phrase רַךְ וְיָחִיד (rakh vÿyakhid, “tender and only one”) is a hendiadys meaning “tender only child.” The adjective רַךְ (rakh) means “tender; delicate” (BDB 940 s. v. רַךְ), and describes a lad who is young and undeveloped in character (e. g., 2 Sam 3:39). The adjective יָחִיד (yakhid) means “only one” (BDB 402 s. v. יָחִיד) and refers to a beloved and prized only child (e. g., Gen 22:2).) before my mother,"},{"number":4,"verse":"he taught me, and he said to me: “Let your heart lay hold of my words; keep my commands so that (tn The imperative with the vav expresses volitional sequence after the preceding imperative: “keep and then you will live,” meaning “keep so that you may live.”) you will live."},{"number":5,"verse":"Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding; do not forget and do not turn aside from the words I speak.

Some treat רֵאשִׁית חָכְמָה (re’shit khokhmah) as a genitive-construct phrase: “the beginning of wisdom” (cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV). Others take רֵאשִׁית as an absolute functioning as predicate and חָכְמָה as the subject: “wisdom is the first/chief thing” (cf. KJV, ASV).

There are two ways to take the genitives: (1) genitives of apposition: wickedness and violence are their food and drink (cf. TEV, CEV, NLT), or (2) genitives of source: they derive their livelihood from the evil they do (C. H. Toy, Proverbs [ICC], 93).) and drink wine obtained from violence. (tn Heb “the wine of violence” (so KJV, NAB, NIV, NRSV). This is a genitive of source, meaning that the wine they drink was plundered from their violent crime.

It is illumined, clear, easy to follow, and healthy and safe – the opposite of what darkness represents.) growing brighter and brighter (tn The construction uses the Qal active participle of הָלַךְ (halakh) in a metaphorical sense to add the idea of continuance or continually to the participle הוֹלֵךְ (holekh).
