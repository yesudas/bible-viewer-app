NEB here translates τόπον διθάλασσον (topon diqalasson) as “cross-currents,” a proposal close to that advanced by J. M. Gilchrist, “The Historicity of Paul’s Shipwreck,” JSNT 61 (1996): 29-51, who suggests the meaning is “a patch of cross-seas,” where the waves are set at an angle to the wind, a particular hazard for sailors. Thus the term most likely refers to some sort of adverse sea conditions rather than a topographical feature like a reef or sandbar.) and ran the ship aground; the bow stuck fast and could not be moved, but the stern was being broken up by the force (tn Or “violence” (BDAG 175 s. v. βία a).) of the waves."},{"number":42,"verse":"Now the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners (sn The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners.
