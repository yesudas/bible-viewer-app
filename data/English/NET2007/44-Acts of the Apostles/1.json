The Greek term πρῶτος (prwtos) does not necessarily mean “first” in an absolute sense, but can refer to the first in a set or series. That is what is intended here – the first account (known as the Gospel of Luke) as compared to the second one (known as Acts).) account, (tn The Greek word λόγος (logos) is sometimes translated “book” (NRSV, NIV) or “treatise” (KJV). A formal, systematic treatment of a subject is implied, but the word “book” may be too specific and slightly misleading to the modern reader, so “account” has been used. sn The former account refers to the Gospel of Luke, which was “volume one” of the two-volume work Luke-Acts.)

Schrenk, TDNT 2:545), so that a word like “orders” conveys the idea more effectively.

The difficulty with the first option is that it does not fit the context, and this meaning is not found elsewhere. The second option is difficult because of the singular number and the present tense.

The difference in meaning between (2) and (3) is not great, but (3) seems to fit the context somewhat better here.) he declared, (tn Grk “ordered them”; the command “Do not leave” is not in Greek but is an indirect quotation in the original (see note at end of the verse for explanation).) “Do not leave Jerusalem, (map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) but wait there (tn The word “there” is not in the Greek text (direct objects in Greek were frequently omitted when clear from the context).) for what my (tn Grk “the,” with the article used as a possessive pronoun (ExSyn 215).)

This abrupt change is very awkward, so the entire quotation has been rendered as direct discourse in the translation.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"For (tn In the Greek text v. 5 is a continuation of the previous sentence, which is long and complicated.
