(map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) His mother was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. (tn The parallel text in 1 Kgs 15:1 identifies his mother as “Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom” [=Absalom, 2 Chr 11:20). Although most English versions identify the mother’s father as Uriel of Gibeah, a number of English versions substitute the name “Maacah” here for the mother (e. g., NIV, NCV, CEV, NLT).) There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam."},{"number":3,"verse":"Abijah launched the attack with 400000 well-trained warriors, (tn Heb “and Abijah bound [i. e., began] the battle with a force of warriors, four hundred thousand chosen men.”) while Jeroboam deployed against him 800000 well-trained warriors. (tn Heb “and Jeroboam arranged with him [for] battle with eight hundred thousand chosen men, strong warrior[s].”)"},{"number":4,"verse":"Abijah ascended Mount Zemaraim, in the Ephraimite hill country, and said: “Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel!"},{"number":5,"verse":"Don’t you realize that the LORD God of Israel has given David and his dynasty lasting dominion over Israel by a formal agreement? (tn Heb “Do you not know that the Lord God of Israel has given kingship to David over Israel permanently, to him and to his sons [by] a covenant of salt?”sn For other references to a “covenant of salt,” see Lev 2:13 and Num 18:19.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master."},{"number":7,"verse":"Lawless good-for-nothing men (tn Heb “empty men, sons of wickedness.”) gathered around him and conspired (tn Heb “strengthened themselves.”) against Rehoboam son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was an inexperienced young man (tn Heb “a young man and tender of heart.”) and could not resist them."},{"number":8,"verse":"Now you are declaring that you will resist the LORD’s rule through the Davidic dynasty. (tn Heb “the kingdom of the Lord by the hand of the sons of David.”) You have a huge army, (tn Or “horde”; or “multitude.”) and bring with you the gold calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods."},{"number":9,"verse":"But you banished (tn In the Hebrew text this is phrased as a rhetorical question, “Did you not banish?” The rhetorical question expects the answer, “Of course you did,” the force of which is reflected in the translation “But you banished.”) the LORD’s priests, Aaron’s descendants, and the Levites, and appointed your own priests just as the surrounding nations do! Anyone who comes to consecrate himself with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of these fake gods! (tn Heb “whoever comes to fill his hand with a bull of a son of cattle, and seven rams, and he is a priest to no-gods.”)"},{"number":10,"verse":"But as for us, the LORD is our God and we have not rejected him.

His priests are ready to blow the trumpets to signal the attack against you.
