NEB, NLT).) from the direction of Edom. (tc Most Hebrew mss read “from Aram” (i. e., Syria), but this must be a corruption of “Edom,” which is the reading of the LXX and Vulgate.)

(tn Heb “they helped, each one his fellow, for destruction.” The verb עָזַר (’azar), traditionally understood as the well-attested verb meaning “to help,” is an odd fit in this context.
