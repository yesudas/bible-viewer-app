Be quick about it!” But the Levites delayed."},{"number":6,"verse":"So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest, (tn Heb “Jehoiada the head”; the word “priest” not in the Hebrew text but is implied.) and said to him, “Why have you not made (tn Heb “sought.”) the Levites collect (tn Heb “bring.”) from Judah and Jerusalem the tax authorized by Moses the LORD’s servant and by the assembly of Israel at the tent containing the tablets of the law?” (tn Heb “the tent of testimony.”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"(Wicked Athaliah and her sons had broken into God’s temple and used all the holy items of the LORD’s temple in their worship of the Baals.)"},{"number":8,"verse":"The king ordered a chest to be made and placed outside the gate of the LORD’s temple.
