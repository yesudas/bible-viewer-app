But here it is probably metaphorical, used of Gentile Christians spread out as God’s people in the midst of a godless world.) (in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, the province of Asia, (tn Grk “Asia”; in the NT this always refers to the Roman province of Asia, made up of about one-third of the west and southwest end of modern Asia Minor.

The meaning of the term εὐλογητός (euloghtos) and the author’s intention at this point in the epistle must both come into play to determine which is the preferred nuance. εὐλογητός as an adjective can mean either that one is praised or that one is blessed, that is, in a place of favor and benefit. Two factors of the author’s style come into play. At this point the author is describing the reality of believers’ salvation and will soon explain believers’ necessary response; this is in emulation of Pauline style which generally follows the same logical order (although the author here discusses the reality in a much more compressed fashion). On the other hand, when imitating the Pauline greeting, which is normally verbless, the author inserts the optative (see v. 2 above). When considered as a whole, although a decision is difficult, the fact that the author in the immediate context has used the optative when imitating a Pauline stylized statement would argue for the optative here. The translation uses the term “blessed” in the sense “worthy of praise” as this is in keeping with the traditional translation of berakah psalms.

The verb looks to be an explanatory gloss. But if no verb is present, this opens up the time frame in the author’s mind even more, since the conditional particle for both the first class condition and the fourth class condition is εἰ (ei). That may well be what was on the author’s mind, as evidenced by some of his other allusions to suffering in this little letter (3:14, 17). NA27 has the verb in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity. tn Grk “Though now, for a little while if necessary, you may have to suffer.”) for a short time in various trials."},{"number":7,"verse":"Such trials show the proven character of your faith, (tn Or “genuineness,” the result of testing.

This is neither as common nor as clear as the verb πιστεύω (pisteuw, “believe, trust”). Consequently, most mss have the present participle πιστεύοντας (pisteuonta\"; Ì72 א C P Ψ 1739 Ï), or the aorist participle πιστεύσαντες (pisteusante\"; 33 pc), while A B pc vg have the adjective. Thus, πιστούς is to be preferred. In the NT the adjective is routinely taken passively in the sense of “faithful” (BDAG 820 s. v. πιστός 1). That may be part of the force here as well: “you are now faithful to God,” although the primary force in this context seems to be that of trusting. Nevertheless, it is difficult to separate faith from faithfulness in NT descriptions of Christians’ dependence on God. tn Grk “who through him [are] trusting,” describing the “you” of v. 20. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.) in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God."},{"number":22,"verse":"You have purified (tn Grk “having purified,” as the preparation for the love described in the second half of the verse.) your souls by obeying the truth (tc Most later mss (P Ï) have διὰ πνεύματος (dia pneumato\", “through the spirit”) after ἀληθείας (ajlhqeia\", “truth”), while the words are lacking in a broad spectrum of early and important witnesses (Ì72 א A B C Ψ 33 81 323 945 1241 1739 al vg sy co). On external grounds, the shorter reading cannot be easily explained if it were not original. The longer reading is clearly secondary, added to show more strongly God’s part in man’s obedience to the truth. But the addition ignores the force that the author gives to “purified” and ruins the balance between v. 22 and v. 23 (for in v. 23 the emphasis is on God’s part; here, on man’s part).) in order to show sincere mutual love.

The omission may have been accidental. In the uncial script (kaqaras kardias) an accidental omission could have happened via homoioteleuton or homoioarcton. καθαρᾶς should be considered original.)"},{"number":23,"verse":"You have been born anew, not from perishable but from imperishable seed, through the living and enduring word of God."},{"number":24,"verse":"For all flesh (sn Here all flesh is a metaphor for humanity – human beings as both frail and temporary.) is like grass and all its glory like the flower of the grass; (tn Or “a wildflower.”) the grass withers and the flower falls off,"},{"number":25,"verse":"but the word of the Lord (sn The word of the Lord is a technical expression in OT literature, often referring to a divine prophetic utterance (e. g., Gen 15:1, Isa 1:10, Jonah 1:1).
