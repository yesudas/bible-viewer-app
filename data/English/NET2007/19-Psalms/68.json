The psalmist depicts God as a mighty warrior and celebrates the fact that God exerts his power on behalf of his people.) God springs into action! (tn Or “rises up.” The verb form is an imperfect, not a jussive. The psalmist is describing God’s appearance in battle in a dramatic fashion.) His enemies scatter; his adversaries (tn Heb “those who hate him.”) run from him. (sn The wording of v. 1 echoes the prayer in Num 10:35: “Spring into action, Lord! Then your enemies will be scattered and your adversaries will run from you.”)"},{"number":2,"verse":"As smoke is driven away by the wind, so you drive them away. (tn Heb “as smoke is scattered, you scatter [them].”) As wax melts before fire, so the wicked are destroyed before God."},{"number":3,"verse":"But the godly (tn By placing the subject first the psalmist highlights the contrast between God’s ecstatic people and his defeated enemies (vv. 1–2).) are happy; they rejoice before God and are overcome with joy. (tn Heb “and they are happy with joy” (cf. NEB). Some translate the prefixed verbal forms of v. 3 as jussives, “Let the godly be happy, let them rejoice before God, and let them be happy with joy!” (Cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV; note the call to praise in v. 4.))"},{"number":4,"verse":"Sing to God! Sing praises to his name! Exalt the one who rides on the clouds! (tn Traditionally the Hebrew term עֲרָבוֹת (’aravot) is taken as “steppe-lands” (often rendered “deserts”), but here the form is probably a homonym meaning “clouds.” Verse 33, which depicts God as the one who “rides on the sky” strongly favors this (see as well Deut 33:26), as does the reference in v. 9 to God as the source of rain. The term עֲרָבָה (’aravah, “cloud”) is cognate with Akkadian urpatu/erpetu and with Ugaritic ’rpt. The phrase rkb ’rpt (“one who rides on the clouds”) appears in Ugaritic mythological texts as an epithet of the storm god Baal. The nonphonemic interchange of the bilabial consonants b and p is attested elsewhere in roots common to Hebrew and Ugaritic, though the phenomenon is relatively rare.) For the LORD is his name! (tc Heb “in the Lord his name.” If the MT is retained, the preposition -בְ (bet) is introducing the predicate (the so-called bet of identity), “the Lord is his name.” However, some prefer to emend the text to כִּי יָהּ שְׁמוֹ (ki yah shÿmo, “for Yah is his name”). This emendation, reflected in the present translation, assumes a confusion of bet (ב) and kaf (כ) and haplography of yod (י).) Rejoice before him!"},{"number":5,"verse":"He is a father to the fatherless and an advocate for widows. (sn God is depicted here as a just ruler. In the ancient Near Eastern world a king was responsible for promoting justice, including caring for the weak and vulnerable, epitomized by the fatherless and widows.) God rules from his holy palace. (tn Heb “God [is] in his holy dwelling place.” He occupies his throne and carries out his royal responsibilities.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"God settles those who have been deserted in their own homes; (tn Heb “God causes the solitary ones to dwell in a house.” The participle suggests this is what God typically does.) he frees prisoners and grants them prosperity. (tn Heb “he brings out prisoners into prosperity.” Another option is to translate, “he brings out prisoners with singing” (cf. NIV). The participle suggests this is what God typically does.) But sinful rebels live in the desert. (tn Or “in a parched [land].”sn God delivers the downtrodden and oppressed, but sinful rebels who oppose his reign are treated appropriately.)"},{"number":7,"verse":"O God, when you lead your people into battle, (tn Heb “when you go out before your people.” The Hebrew idiom “go out before” is used here in a militaristic sense of leading troops into battle (see Judg 4:14; 9:39; 2 Sam 5:24).) when you march through the desert, (sn When you march through the desert. Some interpreters think that v. 7 alludes to Israel’s exodus from Egypt and its subsequent travels in the desert. Another option is that v. 7, like v. 8, echoes Judg 5:4, which describes how the God of Sinai marched across the desert regions to do battle with Sisera and his Canaanite army.) (Selah)"},{"number":8,"verse":"the earth shakes, yes, the heavens pour down rain before God, the God of Sinai, (tn Heb “this one of Sinai.” The phrase is a divine title, perhaps indicating that the Lord rules from Sinai.) before God, the God of Israel. (sn The language of vv. 7–8 is reminiscent of Judg 5:4–5, which tells how the God of Sinai came in the storm and annihilated the Canaanite forces led by Sisera. The presence of allusion does not mean, however, that this is a purely historical reference. The psalmist is describing God’s typical appearance as a warrior in terms of his prior self-revelation as ancient events are reactualized in the psalmist’s experience. (For a similar literary technique, see Hab 3.))"},{"number":9,"verse":"O God, you cause abundant showers to fall (tn The verb נוּף (nuf, “cause rain to fall”) is a homonym of the more common נוּף (“brandish”).) on your chosen people. (tn Heb “[on] your inheritance.” This refers to Israel as God’s specially chosen people (see Pss 28:9; 33:12; 74:2; 78:62, 71; 79:1; 94:5, 14; 106:40). Some take “your inheritance” with what follows, but the vav (ו) prefixed to the following word (note וְנִלְאָה, vÿnil’ah) makes this syntactically unlikely.) When they (tn Heb “it [is],” referring to God’s “inheritance.”) are tired, you sustain them, (tn Heb “it,” referring to God’s “inheritance.”)"},{"number":10,"verse":"for you live among them. (tn The meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear; it appears to read, “your animals, they live in it,” but this makes little, if any, sense in this context. Some suggest that חָיָּה (khayah) is a rare homonym here, meaning “community” (BDB 312 s. v.) or “dwelling place” (HALOT 310 s. v. III *הַיָּה). In this case one may take “your community/dwelling place” as appositional to the third feminine singular pronominal suffix at the end of v. 9, the antecedent of which is “your inheritance.” The phrase יָשְׁבוּ־בָהּ (yashvu-vah, “they live in it”) may then be understood as an asyndetic relative clause modifying “your community/dwelling place.” A literal translation of vv. 9b–10a would be, “when it [your inheritance] is tired, you sustain it, your community/dwelling place in [which] they live.”) You sustain the oppressed with your good blessings, O God."},{"number":11,"verse":"The Lord speaks; (tn Heb “gives a word.” Perhaps this refers to a divine royal decree or battle cry.) many, many women spread the good news. (tn Heb “the ones spreading the good news [are] a large army.” The participle translated “the ones spreading the good news” is a feminine plural form. Apparently the good news here is the announcement that enemy kings have been defeated (see v. 12).)"},{"number":12,"verse":"Kings leading armies run away — they run away! (tn The verbal repetition draws attention to the statement.) The lovely lady (tn The Hebrew form appears to be the construct of נוּה (nuh, “pasture”) but the phrase “pasture of the house” makes no sense here. The translation assumes that the form is an alternative or corruption of נצוה (“beautiful woman”). A reference to a woman would be appropriate in light of v. 11b.) of the house divides up the loot."},{"number":13,"verse":"When (tn Or “if.”) you lie down among the sheepfolds, (tn The meaning of the Hebrew word translated “sheepfolds” is uncertain. There may be an echo of Judg 5:16 here.) the wings of the dove are covered with silver and with glittering gold. (tn Heb “and her pinions with the yellow of gold.”sn The point of the imagery of v. 13 is not certain, though the reference to silver and gold appears to be positive. Both would be part of the loot carried away from battle (see v. 12b).)"},{"number":14,"verse":"When the sovereign judge (tn The divine name used here is שַׁדַּי (“Shaddai”). Shaddai/El Shaddai is the sovereign king/judge of the world who grants life, blesses and kills, and judges. In Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendants. Outside Genesis he both blesses (protects) and takes away life and/or happiness.) scatters kings, (tn The Hebrew text adds “in it.” The third feminine singular pronominal suffix may refer back to God’s community/dwelling place (v. 10).) let it snow (tn The verb form appears to be a Hiphil jussive from שָׁלַג (shalag), which is usually understood as a denominative verb from שֶׁלֶג (sheleg, “snow”) with an indefinite subject. The form could be taken as a preterite, in which case one might translate, “when the sovereign judge scattered kings, it snowed on Zalmon” (cf. NIV, NRSV). The point of the image is unclear. Perhaps “snow” suggests fertility and blessing (see v. 9 and Isa 55:10), or the image of a snow-capped mountain suggests grandeur. sn Zalmon was apparently a mountain in the region, perhaps the one mentioned in Judg 9:46 as being in the vicinity of Shechem.) on Zalmon!"},{"number":15,"verse":"The mountain of Bashan (sn The mountain of Bashan probably refers to Mount Hermon.) is a towering mountain; (tn Heb “a mountain of God.” The divine name is probably used here in a superlative sense to depict a very high mountain (“a mountain fit for God,” as it were). Cf. NIV “are majestic mountains”; NRSV “O mighty mountain.”) the mountain of Bashan is a mountain with many peaks. (tn The meaning of the Hebrew term, which appears only here in the OT, is uncertain. HALOT 174 s. v. גַּבְנוֹן suggests “many-peaked,” while BDB 148 s. v. גַּבְנִן suggests “rounded summit.”)"},{"number":16,"verse":"Why do you look with envy, (tn The meaning of the Hebrew verb רָצַד (ratsad), translated here “look with envy,” is uncertain; it occurs only here in the OT.

(tn Heb “you have taken captives captive.”) You receive tribute (tn Or “gifts.”) from (tn Or “among.”) men, including even sinful rebels. Indeed the LORD God lives there! (tn Heb “so that the Lord God might live [there].” Many take the infinitive construct with -לְ (lamed) as indicating purpose here, but it is unclear how the offering of tribute enables the Lord to live in Zion. This may be an occurrence of the relatively rare emphatic lamed (see HALOT 510-11 s. v. II לְ, though this text is not listed as an example there). If so, the statement corresponds nicely to the final line of v. 16, which also affirms emphatically that the Lord lives in Zion.)"},{"number":19,"verse":"The Lord deserves praise!

However, in militaristic contexts such as Ps 68 this translation is inadequate, for the verb refers in this setting to the warrior’s battle cry, which terrifies and paralyzes the enemy. See A. Caquot, TDOT 3:53, and note the use of the verb in Ps 106:9 and Nah 1:4, as well as the related noun in Job 26:11; Pss 18:15; 76:6; 104:7; Isa 50:2; 51:20; 66:15.) against the wild beast of the reeds, (sn The wild beast of the reeds probably refers to a hippopotamus, which in turn symbolizes the nation of Egypt.) and the nations that assemble like a herd of calves led by bulls!

The Hitpael of this verb appears only here and in Prov 6:3, where it seems to mean, “humble oneself,” a nuance that fits nicely in this context. The apparent subject is “wild beast” or “assembly,” though both of these nouns are grammatically feminine, while the participle is a masculine form. Perhaps one should emend the participial form to a masculine plural (מִתְרַפִּם, mitrapim) and understand “bulls” or “calves” as the subject.) and offer gold and silver as tribute.
