The psalmist praises God for his marvelous deeds, especially the way in which he provides for and delivers his people. The psalm is an acrostic. After the introductory call to praise, every poetic line (twenty-two in all) begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.) Praise the LORD! I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the godly and the congregation."},{"number":2,"verse":"The LORD’s deeds are great, eagerly awaited (tn Heb “sought out.”) by all who desire them."},{"number":3,"verse":"His work is majestic and glorious, (tn For other uses of the Hebrew phrase וְהָדָר-הוֹד (hod-vÿhadar, “majesty and splendor”) see 1 Chr 16:27; Job 40:10; Pss 21:5; 96:6; 104:1.) and his faithfulness endures (tn Or “stands.”) forever."},{"number":4,"verse":"He does (tn Or “did,” if this refers primarily to the events of the exodus and conquest period (see vv. 6, 9).) amazing things that will be remembered; (tn Heb “a memorial he had made for his amazing deeds.”) the LORD is merciful and compassionate."},{"number":5,"verse":"He gives (tn Or “gave,” if the events of the exodus and conquest period (see v. 6, 9) are primarily in view.) food to his faithful followers; (tn Heb “those who fear him.”) he always remembers his covenant. (tn Or “he remembers his covenant forever” (see Ps 105:8).)"},{"number":6,"verse":"He announced that he would do mighty deeds for his people, giving them a land that belonged to other nations. (tn Heb “the strength of his deeds he proclaimed to his people, to give to them an inheritance of nations.”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"His acts are characterized by (tn Heb “the deeds of his hands [are].”) faithfulness and justice; all his precepts are reliable. (tn That is, fair and for man’s good.)"},{"number":8,"verse":"They are forever firm, and should be faithfully and properly carried out. (tn Heb “done in faithfulness and uprightness.” The passive participle probably has the force of a gerund. See L. C. Allen, Psalms 101–150 (WBC), 89.)"},{"number":9,"verse":"He delivered his people; (tn Heb “redemption he sent for his people.”) he ordained that his covenant be observed forever. (tn Heb “he commanded forever his covenant.”) His name is holy and awesome."},{"number":10,"verse":"To obey the LORD is the fundamental principle for wise living; (tn Heb “the beginning of wisdom [is] the fear of the Lord.”) all who carry out his precepts acquire good moral insight. (tn Heb “good sense [is] to all who do them.” The third masculine plural pronominal suffix must refer back to the “precepts” mentioned in v. 7. In the translation the referent has been specified for clarity. The phrase שֵׂכֶל טוֹב (shekhel tov) also occurs in Prov 3:4; 13:15 and 2 Chr 30:22.) He will receive praise forever.
