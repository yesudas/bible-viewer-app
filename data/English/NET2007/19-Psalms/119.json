The psalmist celebrates God’s law and the guidance it provides his people. He expresses his desire to know God’s law thoroughly so that he might experience the blessings that come to those who obey it. This lengthy psalm exhibits an elaborate acrostic pattern. The psalm is divided into twenty-two sections (corresponding to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet), each of which is comprised of eight verses. Each of the verses in the first section (vv. 1–8) begins with the letter alef (א), the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. This pattern continues throughout the psalm as each new section highlights a successive letter of the alphabet. Each verse in section two (vv. 9–16) begins with the second letter of the alphabet, each verse in section three (vv. 17–24) with the third letter, etc. This rigid pattern creates a sense of order and completeness and may have facilitated memorization.) א (Alef) [1] How blessed are those whose actions are blameless, (tn Heb “[Oh] the happiness of those who are blameless of way.”) who obey (tn Heb “walk in.”) the law of the LORD."},{"number":2,"verse":"How blessed are those who observe his rules, and seek him with all their heart,"},{"number":3,"verse":"who, moreover, do no wrong, but follow in his footsteps.

Allen (Psalms 101–150 [WBC], 127, 135) the translation assumes that the verb is cognate with Ugaritic dlp, “to collapse; to crumple” in CTA 2 iv. 17, 26. See G. R.

In this view these words were accidentally repeated from the previous verse. (2) However, it is possible that the psalmist closely associates the law with God himself because he views the law as the expression of the divine will. (3) Another option is that “lifting the hands” does not refer to prayer here, but to the psalmist’s desire to receive and appropriate the law.
