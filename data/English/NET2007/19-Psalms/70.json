(sn Psalm 70. This psalm is almost identical to Ps 40:13–17. The psalmist asks for God’s help and for divine retribution against his enemies.) (tn Heb “to cause to remember.” The same form, a Hiphil infinitive of זָכַר (zakhar, “remember”), also appears in the superscription of Ps 38. Some understand this in the sense of “for the memorial offering,” but it may carry the idea of bringing one’s plight to God’s attention (see P. C. Craigie, Psalms 1–50 [WBC], 303).) O God, please be willing to rescue me! (tn Heb “O God, to rescue me.” A main verb is obviously missing. The verb רָצָה (ratsah, “be willing”) should be supplied (see Ps 40:13). Ps 40:13 uses the divine name “Lord” rather than “God.”) O LORD, hurry and help me! (tn Heb “hurry to my help.” See Pss 22:19; 38:22.)"},{"number":2,"verse":"May those who are trying to take my life be embarrassed and ashamed! (tn Heb “may they be embarrassed and ashamed, the ones seeking my life.” Ps 40:14 has “together” after “ashamed,” and “to snatch it away” after “my life.”) May those who want to harm me be turned back and ashamed! (tn The four prefixed verbal forms in this verse are understood as jussives. The psalmist is calling judgment down on his enemies. sn See Ps 35:4 for a similar prayer.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"May those who say, “Aha! Aha!” be driven back (tn The prefixed verbal form is understood as a jussive in this imprecation.) and disgraced! (tn Heb “May they be turned back according to their shame, those who say, ‘Aha! Aha!’” Ps 40:15 has the verb “humiliated” instead of “turned back” and adds “to me” after “say.”)"},{"number":4,"verse":"May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you! May those who love to experience (tn Heb “those who love,” which stands metonymically for its cause, the experience of being delivered by God.) your deliverance say continually, (tn The three prefixed verbal forms prior to the quotation are understood as jussives. The psalmist balances out his imprecation against his enemies with a prayer of blessing on the godly.) “May God (tn Ps 40:16 uses the divine name “Lord” here instead of “God.”) be praised!” (tn The prefixed verbal form is taken as a jussive, “may the Lord be magnified [in praise].” Another option is to take the verb as an imperfect, “the Lord is great.” See Ps 35:27.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"I am oppressed and needy! (sn See Pss 35:10; 37:14.) O God, hurry to me! (tn Ps 40:17 has “may the Lord pay attention to me.”) You are my helper and my deliverer! O LORD, (tn Ps 40:17 has “my God” instead of “Lord.”) do not delay!"}]}
