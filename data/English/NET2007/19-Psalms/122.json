The psalmist expresses his love for Jerusalem and promises to pray for the city’s security.) (sn The precise significance of this title, which appears in Pss 120–134, is unclear. Perhaps worshipers recited these psalms when they ascended the road to Jerusalem to celebrate annual religious festivals. For a discussion of their background see L. C. Allen, Psalms 101–150 (WBC), 219-21.) I was glad because (tn Heb “in the ones saying to me.” After the verb שָׂמַח (samakh), the preposition בְּ (bet) usually introduces the reason for joy.) they said to me, “We will go to the LORD’s temple.”"},{"number":2,"verse":"Our feet are (tn Or “were.”) standing inside your gates, O Jerusalem."},{"number":3,"verse":"Jerusalem (map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) is a city designed to accommodate an assembly. (tc Heb “Jerusalem, which is built like a city which is joined to her together.” The meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear. Many regard this as a description of the compact way in which the city was designed or constructed. The translation assumes an emendation of the verb חֻבְּרָה (khubbÿrah, “is joined”) to a noun חֶבְרָה (khevrah, “association; company”). The text then reads literally, “Jerusalem, which is built like a city which has a company together.” This in turn can be taken as a reference to Jerusalem’s role as a city where people congregated for religious festivals and other civic occasions (see vv. 4–5).)"},{"number":4,"verse":"The tribes go up (tn Or “went up.”) there, (tn Heb “which is where the tribes go up.”) the tribes of the LORD, where it is required that Israel give thanks to the name of the LORD.
