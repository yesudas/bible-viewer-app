Perhaps the point is that they should rejoice at all times, even when falling asleep or awaking.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"May they praise God while they hold a two-edged sword in their hand, (tn Heb “[May] praises of God [be] in their throat, and a two-edged sword in their hand.”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"in order to take (tn Heb “to do.”) revenge on the nations, and punish foreigners."},{"number":8,"verse":"They bind (tn Heb “to bind.”) their kings in chains, and their nobles in iron shackles,"},{"number":9,"verse":"and execute the judgment to which their enemies (tn Heb “they”; the referent (the enemies of the people of God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) have been sentenced.
