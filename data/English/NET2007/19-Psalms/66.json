The psalmist praises God because he has delivered his people from a crisis.) Shout out praise to God, all the earth!"},{"number":2,"verse":"Sing praises about the majesty of his reputation! (tn Heb “his name,” which here stands metonymically for God’s reputation.) Give him the honor he deserves! (tn Heb “make honorable his praise.”)"},{"number":3,"verse":"Say to God: “How awesome are your deeds! Because of your great power your enemies cower in fear (tn See Deut 33:29; Ps 81:15 for other uses of the verb כָּחַשׁ (kakhash) in the sense “cower in fear.” In Ps 18:44 the verb seems to carry the nuance “be weak, powerless” (see also Ps 109:24).) before you."},{"number":4,"verse":"All the earth worships (tn Or “bows down to.” The prefixed verbal forms in v. 4 are taken (1) as imperfects expressing what is typical.

(tn Heb “awesome [is] an act toward the sons of man.” It is unclear how the prepositional phrase relates to what precedes. If collocated with “act,” it may mean “on behalf of” or “toward.” If taken with “awesome” (see 1 Chr 16:25; Pss 89:7; 96:4; Zeph 2:11), one might translate “his awesome acts are beyond human comprehension” or “his awesome acts are superior to anything men can do.”)"},{"number":6,"verse":"He turned the sea into dry land; (sn He turned the sea into dry land. The psalmist alludes to Israel’s crossing the Red Sea (Exod 14:21).) they passed through the river on foot. (tn Because of the reference to “the river,” some understand this as an allusion to Israel’s crossing the Jordan River. However, the Hebrew term נָהָר (nahad) does not always refer to a “river” in the technical sense; it can be used of sea currents (see Jonah 2:4). So this line may also refer to the Red Sea crossing (cf. NEB).) Let us rejoice in him there!

The Kethib (consonantal text) has a Hiphil form of the verb, apparently to be understood in an exhibitive sense (“demonstrate stubborn rebellion”; see BDB 927 s. v. רוּם Hiph), while the Qere (marginal reading) has a Qal form, to be understood in an intransitive sense.

NEB).
