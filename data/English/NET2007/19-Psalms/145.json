However, in the traditional Hebrew (Masoretic) text of Psalm 145 there is no verse beginning with the letter nun. One would expect such a verse to appear as the fourteenth verse, between the mem (מ) and samek (ס) verses. Several ancient witnesses, including one medieval Hebrew manuscript, the Qumran scroll from cave 11, the LXX, and the Syriac, supply the missing nun (נ) verse, which reads as follows: “The Lord is reliable in all his words, and faithful in all his deeds.” One might paraphrase this as follows: “The Lord’s words are always reliable; his actions are always faithful.” Scholars are divided as to the originality of this verse. L. C. Allen argues for its inclusion on the basis of structural considerations (Psalms 101–150 [WBC], 294-95), but there is no apparent explanation for why, if original, it would have been accidentally omitted. The psalm may be a partial acrostic, as in Pss 25 and 34 (see M. Dahood, Psalms [AB], 3:335). The glaring omission of the nun line would have invited a later redactor to add such a line.) The LORD supports all who fall, and lifts up all who are bent over. (tn Perhaps “discouraged” (see Ps 57:6).)"},{"number":15,"verse":"Everything looks to you in anticipation, (tn Heb “the eyes of all wait for you.”) and you provide them with food on a regular basis.

(tn Heb “in truth.”)"},{"number":19,"verse":"He satisfies the desire (tn In this context “desire” refers to the followers’ desire to be delivered from wicked enemies.) of his loyal followers; (tn Heb “the desire of those who fear him, he does.”) he hears their cry for help and delivers them."},{"number":20,"verse":"The LORD protects those who love him, but he destroys all the wicked."},{"number":21,"verse":"My mouth will praise the LORD.
