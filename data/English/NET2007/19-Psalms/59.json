(sn Psalm 59. The psalmist calls down judgment on his foreign enemies, whom he compares to ravenous wild dogs.) (tn Heb “do not destroy.” Perhaps this refers to a particular style of music, a tune title, or a musical instrument. These words also appear in the superscription to Pss 57–58, 75.) (tn The precise meaning of the Hebrew word מִכְתָּם (miktam), which also appears in the heading to Pss 16, 56–58, 60 is uncertain. HALOT 582-83 s. v. defines it as “inscription.”) (tn Heb “when Saul sent and they watched his house in order to kill him.”sn According to the superscription, David wrote this psalm on the occasion when Saul sent assassins to surround David’s house and kill him in the morning (see 1 Sam 19:11). However, the psalm itself mentions foreign enemies (vv. 5, 8). Perhaps these references reflect a later adaptation of an original Davidic psalm.) Deliver me from my enemies, my God!

(tn Heb “from the workers of wickedness.”) Rescue me from violent men! (tn Heb “from men of bloodshed.”)"},{"number":3,"verse":"For look, they wait to ambush me; (tn Heb “my life.”) powerful men stalk (tn The Hebrew verb is from the root גּוּר (gur), which means “to challenge, attack” in Isa 54:15 and “to stalk” (with hostile intent) in Ps 56:8.) me, but not because I have rebelled or sinned, O LORD. (sn The point is that the psalmist’s enemies have no justifiable reason for attacking him. He has neither rebelled or sinned against the Lord.)"},{"number":4,"verse":"Though I have done nothing wrong, (tn Heb “without sin.”) they are anxious to attack. (tn Heb “they run and they are determined.”) Spring into action and help me! Take notice of me!

The following question (“Who hears?”) is spoken by the psalmist’s enemies, who are confident that no one else can hear their threats against the psalmist.
