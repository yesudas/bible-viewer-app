The psalmist praises God as the ruler of the world who sustains all life.) Praise the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, you are magnificent. (tn Heb “very great.”) You are robed in splendor and majesty."},{"number":2,"verse":"He covers himself with light as if it were a garment. He stretches out the skies like a tent curtain,"},{"number":3,"verse":"and lays the beams of the upper rooms of his palace on the rain clouds. (tn Heb “one who lays the beams on water [in] his upper rooms.” The “water” mentioned here corresponds to the “waters above” mentioned in Gen 1:7. For a discussion of the picture envisioned by the psalmist, see L. I. J. Stadelmann, The Hebrew Conception of the World, 44-45.) He makes the clouds his chariot, and travels along on the wings of the wind. (sn Verse 3 may depict the Lord riding a cherub, which is in turn propelled by the wind current. Another option is that the wind is personified as a cherub. See Ps 18:10 and the discussion of ancient Near Eastern parallels to the imagery in M. Weinfeld, “‘Rider of the Clouds’ and ‘Gatherer of the Clouds’,” JANESCU 5 (1973): 422-24.)"},{"number":4,"verse":"He makes the winds his messengers, and the flaming fire his attendant. (tc Heb “and his attendants a flaming fire.” The lack of agreement between the singular “fire” and plural “attendants” has prompted various emendations. Some read “fire and flame.” The present translation assumes an emendation to “his attendant” (יו in the Hebrew text being virtually dittographic). sn In Ugaritic mythology Yam’s messengers appear as flaming fire before the assembly of the gods. See G. R. Driver, Canaanite Myths and Legends, 42.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be upended."},{"number":6,"verse":"The watery deep covered it (tc Heb “you covered it.” The masculine suffix is problematic if the grammatically feminine noun “earth” is the antecedent. For this reason some emend the form to a feminine verb with feminine suffix, כִּסַּתָּה (kisattah, “[the watery deep] covered it [i. e., the earth]”), a reading assumed by the present translation.) like a garment; the waters reached (tn Heb “stood.”) above the mountains.

(tn Heb “a boundary you set up, they will not cross, they will not return to cover the earth.”)"},{"number":10,"verse":"He turns springs into streams; (tn Heb “[the] one who sends springs into streams.” Another option is to translate, “he sends streams [i. e., streams that originate from springs] into the valleys” (cf. NIV).) they flow between the mountains."},{"number":11,"verse":"They provide water for all the animals in the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst."},{"number":12,"verse":"The birds of the sky live beside them; they chirp among the bushes.

(tn Heb “from the fruit of your works the earth is full.” The translation assumes that “fruit” is literal here. If “fruit” is understood more abstractly as “product; result,” then one could translate, “the earth flourishes as a result of your deeds” (cf. NIV, NRSV, REB).)"},{"number":14,"verse":"He provides grass (tn Heb “causes the grass to sprout up.”) for the cattle, and crops for people to cultivate, (tn Heb “for the service of man” (see Gen 2:5).) so they can produce food from the ground, (tn Heb “to cause food to come out from the earth.”)"},{"number":15,"verse":"as well as wine that makes people feel so good, (tn Heb “and wine [that] makes the heart of man happy.”) and so they can have oil to make their faces shine, (tn Heb “to make [the] face shine from oil.” The Hebrew verb צָהַל (tsahal, “to shine”) occurs only here in the OT. It appears to be an alternate form of צָהַר (tsahar), a derivative from צָהָרִים (tsaharim, “noon”).) as well as food that sustains people’s lives.
