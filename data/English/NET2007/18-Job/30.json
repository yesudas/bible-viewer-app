The next verse will explain why.) to put with my sheep dogs. (sn Job is mocked by young fellows who come from low extraction. They mocked their elders and their betters.

Among the proposals for אֶמֶשׁ (’emesh), Duhm suggested יְמַשְּׁשׁוּ (yÿmashÿshu, “they grope”), which would require darkness; Pope renders “by night,” instead of “yesterday,” which evades the difficulty; and Fohrer suggested with more reason אֶרֶץ (’erets), “a desolate and waste land.” R. Gordis (Job, 331) suggests יָמִישׁוּ / יָמֻשׁוּ (yamishu/yamushu), “they wander off.”)"},{"number":4,"verse":"By the brush (tn Or “the leaves of bushes” (ESV), a possibility dating back to Saadia and discussed by G.

In this verse יִתְרוֹ (yitro, the Kethib, LXX, and Vulgate) would mean “his rope” (see יֶתֶר [yeter] in Judg 16:7–9). The Qere would be יִתְרִי (yitri, “my rope [or cord]”), meaning “me.” The word could mean “rope,” “cord,” or “bowstring.” If the reading “my cord” is accepted, the cord would be something like “my tent cord” (as in Job 29:20), more than K&D 12:147 “cord of life.” This has been followed in the present translation. If it were “my bowstring,” it would give the sense of disablement. If “his cord” is taken, it would signify that the restraint that God had in afflicting Job was loosened – nothing was held back.) my tent cord and afflicted me, people throw off all restraint in my presence.

The word פִּרְחַח (pirkhakh, “young rabble”) is a quadriliteral, from פָּרַח (parakh, “to bud”) The derivative אֶפְרֹחַ (’efroakh) in the Bible refers to a young bird. In Arabic farhun means both “young bird” and “base man.” Perhaps “young rabble” is the best meaning here (see R. Gordis, Job, 333).) rise up; they drive me from place to place, (tn Heb “they cast off my feet” or “they send my feet away.” Many delete the line as troubling and superfluous. E.

Guillaume, drawing from Arabic, has “where the gap is made.”) they come rolling in. (tn The verb, the Hitpalpel of גָּלַל (galal), means “they roll themselves.” This could mean “they roll themselves under the ruins” (Dhorme), “they roll on like a storm” (Gordis), or “they roll on” as in waves of enemy attackers (see H. H. Rowley). This particular verb form is found only here (but see Amos 5:24).)"},{"number":15,"verse":"Terrors are turned loose (tn The passive singular verb (Hophal) is used with a plural subject (see GKC 388 §121. b).) on me; they drive away (tc This translation assumes that “terrors” (in the plural) is the subject.

The LXX has “my nerves,” a view accepted by many commentators.) never cease."},{"number":18,"verse":"With great power God (tn Heb “he”; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) grasps my clothing; (tc This whole verse is difficult. The first problem is that this verb in the MT means “is disguised [or disfigured],” indicating that Job’s clothes hang loose on him. But many take the view that the verb is a phonetic variant of חָבַשׁ (khavash, “to bind; to seize”) and that the Hitpael form is a conflation of the third and second person because of the interchange between them in the passage (R. Gordis, Job, 335). The commentaries list a number of conjectural emendations, but the image in the verse is probably that God seizes Job by the garment and throws him down.) he binds me like the collar (tn The phrase “like the collar” is difficult, primarily because their tunics did not have collars. A translation of “neck” would suit better.

The sudden change from third person (v. 19) to second person (v. 20) is indicative of the intense emotion of the sufferer.) but you do not answer me; I stand up, (sn The verb is simple, but the interpretation difficult. In this verse it probably means he stands up in prayer (Jer 15:1), but it could mean that he makes his case to God. Others suggest a more figurative sense, like the English expression “stand pat,” meaning “remain silent” (see Job 29:8).) and you only look at me. (tn If the idea of prayer is meant, then a pejorative sense to the verb is required. Some supply a negative and translate “you do not pay heed to me.” This is supported by one Hebrew ms and the Vulgate. The Syriac has the whole colon read with God as the subject, “you stand and look at me.”)"},{"number":21,"verse":"You have become cruel to me; (tn The idiom uses the Niphal verb “you are turned” with “to cruelty.” See Job 41:20b, as well as Isa 63:10.) with the strength of your hand you attack me.

God has sent his storms, and Job is blown away.) you toss me about (tn The verb means “to melt.” The imagery would suggest softening the ground with the showers (see Ps 65:10 [11]). The translation “toss…about” comes from the Arabic cognate that is used for the surging of the sea.) in the storm. (tc The Qere is תּוּשִׁיָּה (tushiyyah, “counsel”), which makes no sense here. The Kethib is a variant orthography for תְּשֻׁאָה (tÿshu’ah, “storm”).)"},{"number":23,"verse":"I know that you are bringing (tn The imperfect verb would be a progressive imperfect, it is future, but it is also already underway.) me to death, to the meeting place for all the living."},{"number":24,"verse":"The Contrast With the Past “Surely one does not stretch out his hand against a broken man (tc Here is another very difficult verse, as is attested by the differences among commentaries and translations. The MT has “surely not against a ruinous heap will he [God] put forth his [God’s] hand.” But A. B. Davidson takes Job as the subject, reading “does not one stretch out his hand in his fall?” The RSV suggests a man walking in the ruins and using his hand for support. Dillmann changed it to “drowning man” to say “does not a drowning man stretch out his hand?” Beer has “have I not given a helping hand to the poor?” Dhorme has, “I did not strike the poor man with my hand.” Kissane follows this but retains the verb form, “one does not strike the poor man with his hand.”) when he cries for help in his distress. (tc The second colon is also difficult; it reads, “if in his destruction to them he cries.” E. Dhorme (Job, 425-26) explains how he thinks “to them” came about, and he restores “to me.” This is the major difficulty in the line, and Dhorme’s suggestion is the simplest resolution.)"},{"number":25,"verse":"Have I not wept for the unfortunate?
