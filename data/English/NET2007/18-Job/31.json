The second line of the verse then might build on this to explain what kind of a slave – a concubine (see A. B. Davidson, Job, 215).) for another man, and may other men have sexual relations with her. (tn Heb “bow down over her,” an idiom for sexual relations. sn The idea is that if Job were guilty of adultery it would be an offense against the other woman’s husband, and so by talionic justice another man’s adultery with Job’s wife would be an offense against him. He is not wishing something on his wife; rather, he is simply looking at what would be offenses in kind.)"},{"number":11,"verse":"For I would have committed (tn Heb “for that [would be].” In order to clarify the referent of “that,” which refers to v. 9 rather than v. 10, the words “I have committed” have been supplied in the translation.) a shameful act, (tn The word for “shameful act” is used especially for sexual offenses (cf. Lev 18:27).) an iniquity to be judged. (tc Some have deleted this verse as being short and irrelevant, not to mention problematic. But the difficulties are not insurmountable, and there is no reason to delete it. There is a Kethib-Qere reading in each half verse; in the first the Kethib is masculine for the subject but the Qere is feminine going with “shameless deed.” In the second colon the Kethib is the feminine agreeing with the preceding noun, but the Qere is masculine agreeing with “iniquity.”tn The expression עָוֹן פְּלִילִים (’avon pÿlilim) means “an iniquity of the judges.” The first word is not spelled as a construct noun, and so this has led some to treat the second word as an adjective (with enclitic mem [ם]). The sense is similar in either case, for the adjective occurs in Job 31:28 meaning “calling for judgment” (See GKC 427 §131. s).)"},{"number":12,"verse":"For it is a fire that devours even to Destruction, (tn Heb “to Abaddon.”) and it would uproot (tn The verb means “to root out,” but this does not fit the parallelism with fire.

It means, “if I saw someone dying and if he did not thank me for clothing them.” It is Job’s way of saying that whenever he saw a need he met it, and he received his share of thanks – which prove his kindness. G. R. Driver has it “without his loins having blessed me,” taking “If…not” as an Aramaism, meaning “except” (AJSL 52 [1935/36]: 164f.).) as he warmed himself with the fleece of my sheep, (tn This clause is interpreted here as a subordinate clause to the first half of the verse.

(tn The word קָנֶה (qaneh) is “reed; shaft; beam,” and here “shoulder joint.” All the commentaries try to explain how “reed” became “socket; joint.” This is the only place that it is used in such a sense.

But the MT makes clear sense as it stands.) and by reason of his majesty (tn The form is וּמִשְּׂאֵתוֹ (umissÿ’eto); the preposition is causal.

H. Rowley suggests that the hand was important in waving or throwing the kisses of homage to the sun and the moon, and so it receives the focus. This is the only place in the OT that refers to such a custom. Outside the Bible it was known, however.)"},{"number":28,"verse":"then this (tn Heb “it.”) also would be iniquity to be judged, (tn See v. 11 for the construction.

But it is still sin.) for I would have been false (tn The verb כָּחַשׁ (kakhash) in the Piel means “to deny.” The root meaning is “to deceive; to disappoint; to grow lean.” Here it means that he would have failed or proven unfaithful because his act would have been a denial of God.) to God above."},{"number":29,"verse":"If (tn The problem with taking this as “if,” introducing a conditional clause, is finding the apodosis, if there is one. It may be that the apodosis is understood, or summed up at the end. This is the view taken here. But R. Gordis (Job, 352) wishes to take this word as the indication of the interrogative, forming the rhetorical question to affirm he has never done this. However, in that case the parenthetical verses inserted become redundant.) I have rejoiced over the misfortune of my enemy (sn The law required people to help their enemies if they could (Exod 23:4; also Prov 20:22). But often in the difficulties that ensued, they did exult over their enemies’ misfortune (Pss 54:7; 59:10 [11], etc.). But Job lived on a level of purity that few ever reach. Duhm said, “If chapter 31 is the crown of all ethical developments of the O.

Some commentators transfer the verses around to make them fit the constructions. But the better view is that there is no apodosis – that Job broke off here, feeling it was useless to go further. Now he will address God and not men. But in vv. 38–40b he does return to a self-imprecation. However, there is not sufficient reason to start rearranging all the verses.)"},{"number":35,"verse":"(Job’s Appeal) “If only I had (tn The optative is again introduced with “who will give to me hearing me? – O that someone would listen to me!”) someone to hear me!

In paleo-Hebrew the letter was in the form of a cross or an “X,” and so used for one making a mark or a signature. In this case Job has signed his statement and delivered it to the court – but he has yet to be charged. Kissane thought that this being the last letter of the alphabet, Job was saying, “This is my last word.” Others take the word to mean “desire” – “this is my desire, that God would answer me” (see E. F. Sutcliffe, “Notes on Job, textual and exegetical,” Bib 30 [1949]: 71-72; G. R. Driver, AJSL 3 [1935/36]: 166; P. P.
