The Speeches of Elihu (32:1-37:24)) (Elihu’s First Speech) (sn There are now four speeches from another friend of Job, Elihu. But Job does not reply to any of these, nor does the Lord. The speeches show a knowledge of the debate that has gone on, but they take a different approach entirely. Elihu’s approach is that suffering is a discipline from God, to teach his people. In other words, Job was suffering to vindicate God’s confidence in him. His speeches are an interesting part of the book, but they too are irrelevant to Job’s actual case. In the first speech, there is a short introduction (32:1–5), and then the speech proper with these sections: Elihu will speak because his youth is wiser (32:6–14), and his friends arguments failed (32:15–22); he calls for Job’s attention (33:1–7), claims Job’s case is wrong (33:8–13), and Job’s argument that God does not answer is false (33:14–28), and then makes an appeal to Job (33:29–33). It becomes evident that Elihu correctly identified Job’s determination to maintain his integrity at God’s expense as the primary problem in at least the latter stages of the dialogues (32:1–3; 34:37; 35:16; cf. 38:2; 40:8; 42:3). Elihu was respectful of his elders (32:4), but remained uninfected by their error (32:14). He sought to maintain impartiality (32:21–22) and to offer true wisdom (33:33), believed like Job that a mediator existed (33:23–24), and desired Job’s vindication (33:32). In addition, Elihu focused on vindicating God’s actions (34:12; 35:10–11; 36:2–3, 22–26) and announced the coming theophany (37:1–5, 22). It appears that he was not included in the divine condemnation of Job’s friends (42:7–9) and was excluded from Job’s prayer of intercession (42:8–10) – both perhaps implying divine approval of his behavior and words.) So these three men refused to answer (tn The form is the infinitive construct (“answer”) functioning as the object of the preposition; the phrase forms the complement of the verb “they ceased to answer” (= “they refused to answer further”).)

Gordis (Job, 368) calls this a breviloquence: “beware lest [you say].” He then suggests the best reading for their quote to be, “We have attained wisdom, but only God can refute him, not man.” H. H. Rowley (Job [NCBC], 209) suggests the meaning is a little different, namely, that they are saying they have found wisdom in Job, and only God can deal with it.
