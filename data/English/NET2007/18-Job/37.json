Some commentators suppress the repeated verb “thunders,” and supply other verbs like “shows” or “works,” enabling them to make “wonders” the object of the verb rather than leaving it in an adverbial role.

The verb “to be” can mean “to happen, to fall, to come about.”) to earth,’ and to the torrential rains, (tn Heb “and [to the] shower of rain and shower of rains, be strong.” Many think the repetition grew up by variant readings; several Hebrew mss delete the second pair, and so many editors do. But the repetition may have served to stress the idea that the rains were heavy.) ‘Pour down.’ (tn Heb “Be strong.”)"},{"number":7,"verse":"He causes everyone to stop working, (tn Heb “by the hand of every man he seals.” This line is intended to mean with the heavy rains God suspends all agricultural activity.) so that all people (tc This reading involves a change in the text, for in MT “men” is in the construct. It would be translated, “all men whom he made” (i. e., all men of his making”). This is the translation followed by the NIV and NRSV. Olshausen suggested that the word should have been אֲנָשִׁים (’anashim) with the final ם (mem) being lost to haplography.) may know (tn D. W. Thomas suggested a meaning of “rest” for the verb, based on Arabic.

There is another way of reading this verse: the word translated “bright” means “dark; obscured” in Syriac.
