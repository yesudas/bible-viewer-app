BDAG 18 s. v. ἀδελφός 1, where considerable nonbiblical evidence for the plural ἀδελφοί [adelfoi] meaning “brothers and sisters” is cited). The translation “fellow believer” would normally apply (L&N 11.23), but since the speaker(s) are not specified in this context, it is not clear if such a translation would be appropriate here. The more generic “brothers and sisters” was chosen to emphasize the fact of a relationship without specifying its type.) the one who accuses them day and night (tn Or “who accuses them continually.”) before our God, has been thrown down."},{"number":11,"verse":"But (tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “but” to indicate the contrast.) they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives (sn They did not love their lives.

Because English tends to use shorter sentences (especially when exclamations are involved), a new sentence was started here in the translation.) is filled with terrible anger, for he knows that he only has a little time!”"},{"number":13,"verse":"Now (tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “now” because the clause it introduces is clearly resumptive.) when the dragon realized (tn Grk “saw.”) that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child."},{"number":14,"verse":"But (tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “but” to indicate the contrast present here.) the woman was given the two wings of a giant eagle so that she could fly out into the wilderness, (tn Or “desert.”) to the place God (tn The word “God” is supplied based on the previous statements made concerning “the place prepared for the woman” in 12:6.) prepared for her, where she is taken care of — away from the presence of the serpent — for a time, times, and half a time. (tc The reading “and half a time” (καὶ ἥμισυ καιροῦ, kai {hmisu kairou) is lacking in the important uncial C. Its inclusion, however, is supported by {Ì47 א A and the rest of the ms tradition}. There is apparently no reason for the scribe of C to intentionally omit the phrase, and the fact that the word “time” (καιρὸν καὶ καιρούς, kairon kai kairou\") appears twice before may indicate a scribal oversight. sn The parallel statement in Rev 12:6 suggests that the phrase a time, times, and half a time equals 1260 days (three and a half years of 360 days each).)"},{"number":15,"verse":"Then (tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “then” to indicate the implied sequence of events within the vision.) the serpent spouted water like a river out of his mouth after the woman in an attempt to (tn Grk “so that he might make her swept away.”) sweep her away by a flood,"},{"number":16,"verse":"but (tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “but” to indicate the contrast present here.) the earth came to her rescue; (tn Grk “the earth helped the woman.”) the ground opened up (tn Grk “the earth opened its mouth” (a metaphor for the ground splitting open).) and swallowed the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth."},{"number":17,"verse":"So (tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “so” to indicate the implied result of the woman’s escape.) the dragon became enraged at the woman and went away to make war on the rest of her children, (tn Grk “her seed” (an idiom for offspring, children, or descendants).) those who keep (tn Or “who obey.”) God’s commandments and hold to (tn Grk “and having.”) the testimony about Jesus. (tn Grk “the testimony of Jesus,” which may involve a subjective genitive (“Jesus’ testimony”) or, more likely, an objective genitive (“testimony about Jesus”).) (18)And the dragon (tn Grk “he”; the referent (the dragon) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) stood (tc Grk ἐστάθη (estaqh, “he stood”). The reading followed by the translation is attested by the better mss (Ì47 א A C 1854 2344 2351 pc lat syh) while the majority of mss (051 Ï vgmss syph co) have the reading ἐστάθην (estaqhn, “I stood”). Thus, the majority of mss make the narrator, rather than the dragon of 12:17, the subject of the verb. The first person reading is most likely an assimilation to the following verb in 13:1, “I saw.” The reading “I stood” was introduced either by accident or to produce a smoother flow, giving the narrator a vantage point on the sea’s edge from which to observe the beast rising out of the sea in 13:1. But almost everywhere else in the book, the phrase καὶ εἶδον (kai eidon, “and I saw”) marks a transition to a new vision, without reference to the narrator’s activity. On both external and internal grounds, it is best to adopt the third person reading, “he stood.”) on the sand (tn Or “sandy beach” (L&N 1.64).) of the seashore. (sn The standard critical texts of the Greek NT, NA27 and UBS4, both include this sentence as 12:18, as do the RSV and NRSV. Other modern translations like the NASB and NIV include the sentence at the beginning of 13:1; in these versions chap. 12 has only 17 verses.)"}]}
