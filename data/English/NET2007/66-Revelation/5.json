The particle ὡς is used in Greek generally for comparison, and in Revelation it is used often to describe the appearance of what the author saw. This phrase does not imply that the Lamb “appeared to have been killed” but in reality was not, because the wider context of the NT shows that in fact the Lamb, i. e., Jesus, was killed. See 13:3 for the only other occurrence of this phrase in the NT.)

A few mss (1 vgms) delete the reference to God altogether and simply replace it with “us” (ἡμᾶς).
