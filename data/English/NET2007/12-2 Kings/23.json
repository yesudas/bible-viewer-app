So he ordered the bones from the tombs to be brought; (tn Heb “and he sent and took the bones from the tombs.”) he burned them on the altar and defiled it.

King Josiah (tn Heb “the king”; this has been specified as “King Josiah” in the translation for clarity (cf. TEV, CEV, NLT).) turned and saw the grave of the prophet who had foretold this. (tc The MT is much shorter than this. It reads, “according to the word of the Lord which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.” The LXX has a much longer text at this point. It reads: “[which was proclaimed by the man of God] while Jeroboam stood by the altar at a celebration. Then he turned and saw the grave of the man of God [who proclaimed these words].” The extra material attested in the LXX was probably accidentally omitted in the Hebrew tradition when a scribe’s eye jumped from the first occurrence of the phrase “man of God” (which appears right before the extra material) and the second occurrence of the phrase (which appears at the end of the extra material). sn This recalls the prophecy recorded in 1 Kgs 13:2.)"},{"number":17,"verse":"He asked, “What is this grave marker I see?” The men from the city replied, “It’s the grave of the prophet (tn Heb “man of God.”) who came from Judah and foretold these very things you have done to the altar of Bethel.”"},{"number":18,"verse":"The king (tn Heb “he”; the referent (the king) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) said, “Leave it alone! No one must touch his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed, as well as the bones of the Israelite prophet buried beside him. (tn Heb “and they left undisturbed his bones, the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.” If the phrase “the bones of the prophet” were appositional to “his bones,” one would expect the sentence to end “from Judah” (see v. 17). Apparently the “prophet” referred to in the second half of the verse is the old prophet from Bethel who buried the man of God from Judah in his own tomb and instructed his sons to bury his bones there as well (1 Kgs 13:30–31). One expects the text to read “from Bethel,” but “Samaria” (which was not even built at the time of the incident recorded in 1 Kgs 13) is probably an anachronistic reference to the northern kingdom in general.
