His mother (tn Heb “the name of his mother.”) was Hephzibah."},{"number":2,"verse":"He did evil in the sight of (tn Heb “in the eyes of.”) the LORD and committed the same horrible sins practiced by the nations (tn Heb “like the abominable practices of the nations.”) whom the LORD drove out from before the Israelites."},{"number":3,"verse":"He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he set up altars for Baal and made an Asherah pole just like King Ahab of Israel had done.

He set up a ritual pit to conjure up underworld spirits, and appointed magicians to supervise it. (tn Heb “and he set up a ritual pit, along with conjurers.” The Hebrew אוֹב (’ov), “ritual pit,” refers to a pit used by a magician to conjure up underworld spirits. In 1 Sam 28:7 the witch of Endor is called a בַעֲלַת אוֹב (ba’alat ’ov), “owner of a ritual pit.” See H. Hoffner, “Second millennium Antecedents to the Hebrew ’OñBù,” JBL 86 (1967), 385-401.) He did a great amount of evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger. (tc Heb “and he multiplied doing what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, angering.” The third masculine singular pronominal suffix (“him”) has been accidentally omitted in the MT by haplography (note the vav that immediately follows).)"},{"number":7,"verse":"He put an idol of Asherah he had made in the temple, about which the LORD had said to David and to his son Solomon, “This temple in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will be my permanent home.

(tn Heb “I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria, and the plumb line of the house of Ahab.” The measuring line and plumb line are normally used in building a structure, not tearing it down. But here they are used ironically as metaphors of judgment, emphasizing that he will give careful attention to the task of judgment.) I will wipe Jerusalem clean, just as one wipes a plate on both sides. (tn Heb “just as one wipes a plate, wiping and turning [it] on its face.” The word picture emphasizes how thoroughly the Lord will judge the city.)"},{"number":14,"verse":"I will abandon this last remaining tribe among my people (tn Heb “the remnant of my inheritance.” In this context the Lord’s remnant is the tribe of Judah, which had been preserved when the Assyrians conquered and deported the northern tribes.

Tadmor, II Kings (AB), 269.) and hand them over to their enemies; they will be plundered and robbed by all their enemies, (tn Heb “they will become plunder and spoils of war for all their enemies.”)"},{"number":15,"verse":"because they have done evil in my sight (tn Heb “in my eyes.”) and have angered me from the time their ancestors left Egypt right up to this very day!’”"},{"number":16,"verse":"Furthermore Manasseh killed so many innocent people, he stained Jerusalem with their blood from end to end, (tn Heb “and also Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, until he filled Jerusalem from mouth to mouth.”) in addition to encouraging Judah to sin by doing evil in the sight of the LORD.
