(tc Heb “in it he walked.” The singular verb (הָלַךְ, halakh) is probably due to an error of haplography and should be emended to the plural (הָלְכּוּ, halÿku). Note that a vav immediately follows (on the form וְגַם, vÿgam).) There was even an Asherah pole (tn Or “an image of Asherah”; ASV, NASB “the Asherah”; NCV “the Asherah idol.”sn Asherah was a leading deity of the Canaanite pantheon, wife/sister of El and goddess of fertility. She was commonly worshiped at shrines in or near groves of evergreen trees, or, failing that, at places marked by wooden poles. These were to be burned or cut down (Deut 12:3; 16:21; Judg 6:25, 28, 30; 2 Kgs 18:4).) standing in Samaria."},{"number":7,"verse":"Jehoahaz had no army left (tn Heb “Indeed he did not leave to Jehoahaz people.” The identity of the subject is uncertain, but the king of Syria, mentioned later in the verse, is a likely candidate.) except for fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and 10000 foot soldiers.

The chariot (tn Though the noun is singular here, it may be collective, in which case it could be translated “chariots.”) and horsemen of Israel!” (sn By comparing Elisha to a one-man army, the king emphasizes the power of the prophetic word.

But now, you will defeat Syria only three times.”"},{"number":20,"verse":"Elisha died and was buried. (tn Heb “and they buried him.”) Moabite raiding parties invaded (tn Heb “entered.”) the land at the beginning of the year.
