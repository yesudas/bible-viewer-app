He sent messengers with these orders, (tn Heb “and he sent messengers and said to them.”) “Go, ask (tn That is, “seek an oracle from.”) Baal Zebub, (sn Apparently Baal Zebub refers to a local manifestation of the god Baal at the Philistine city of Ekron. The name appears to mean “Lord of the Flies,” but it may be a deliberate scribal corruption of Baal Zebul, “Baal, the Prince,” a title known from the Ugaritic texts. For further discussion and bibliography, see HALOT 261 s. v. זְבוּב בַּעַל and M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, II Kings (AB), 25.) the god of Ekron, if I will survive this injury.”"},{"number":3,"verse":"But the LORD’s angelic messenger told Elijah the Tishbite, “Get up, go to meet the messengers from the king of Samaria.

The account of Elijah encountering the messengers and delivering the Lord’s message is omitted; we only here of it as the messengers report what happened to the king.) he asked them, “Why have you returned?”"},{"number":6,"verse":"They replied, (tn Heb “said to him.”) “A man came up to meet us.

(tn Heb “Is it because there is no God in Israel [that] you are sending to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?” The translation seeks to bring out the sarcastic tone of the rhetorical question. In v. 3 the messengers are addressed (in the phrase “you are on your way” the second person plural pronoun is used in Hebrew), but here the king is addressed (in the phrase “you are sending” the second person singular pronoun is used).) Therefore you will not leave the bed you lie on, for you will certainly die.”’”"},{"number":7,"verse":"The king (tn Heb “he”; the referent (the king) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) asked them, “Describe the appearance (tn Heb “What was the manner…?”) of this man who came up to meet you and told you these things.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"They replied, (tn Heb “said to him.”) “He was a hairy man (tn Heb “an owner of hair.” This idiomatic expression indicates that Elijah was very hairy. For other examples where the idiom “owner of” is used to describe a characteristic of someone, see HALOT 143 s. v. בַּעַל. For example, an “owner of dreams” is one who frequently has dreams (Gen 37:19) and an “owner of anger” is a hot-tempered individual (Prov 22:24).) and had a leather belt (tn Heb “belt of skin” (i. e., one made from animal hide).) tied around his waist.” The king (tn Heb “he”; the referent (the king) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) said, “He is Elijah the Tishbite.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"The king (tn Heb “he”; the referent (the king) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) sent a captain and his fifty soldiers (tn Heb “officer of fifty and his fifty.”) to retrieve Elijah. (tn Heb “to him.”) The captain (tn Heb “he”; the referent (the captain) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) went up to him, while he was sitting on the top of a hill. (sn The prophet Elijah’s position on the top of the hill symbolizes his superiority to the king and his messengers.) He told him, “Prophet, (tn Heb “man of God” (also in vv. 10, 11, 12, 13).) the king says, ‘Come down!’”"},{"number":10,"verse":"Elijah replied to the captain, (tn Heb “answered and said to the officer of fifty.”) “If I am indeed a prophet, may fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty soldiers!” Fire then came down (tn Wordplay contributes to the irony here.

See v. 9.) “Prophet, this is what the king says, ‘Come down at once!’” (sn In this second panel of the three-paneled narrative, the king and his captain are more arrogant than before.

Whether one translates אֱלֹהִים (’elohim) here as a proper name or idiomatically, this addition to the narrative (the name is omitted in the first panel, v. 10b) emphasizes the severity of the judgment and is appropriate given the more intense command delivered by the king to the prophet in this panel.) came down from the sky and consumed him and his fifty soldiers."},{"number":13,"verse":"The king (tn Heb “he”; the referent (the king) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) sent a third captain and his fifty soldiers.

Don’t be afraid of him.” So he got up and went down (sn In this third panel the verb “come down” (יָרַד, yarad) occurs again, this time describing Elijah’s descent from the hill at the Lord’s command. The moral of the story seems clear: Those who act as if they have authority over God and his servants just may pay for their arrogance with their lives; those who, like the third commander, humble themselves and show the proper respect for God’s authority and for his servants will be spared and find God quite cooperative.) with him to the king."},{"number":16,"verse":"Elijah (tn Heb “he”; the referent (Elijah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) said to the king, (tn Heb “him”; the referent (the king) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) “This is what the LORD says, ‘You sent messengers to seek an oracle from Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron.

The repetition emphasizes one of the chapter’s main themes. Israel’s leaders should seek guidance from their own God, not a pagan deity, for Israel’s sovereign God is the one who controls life and death.)"},{"number":17,"verse":"He died just as the LORD had prophesied through Elijah.

(tn Heb “Jehoram replaced him as king…because he had no son.” Some ancient textual witnesses add “his brother,” which was likely added on the basis of the statement later in the verse that Ahaziah had no son.)"},{"number":18,"verse":"The rest of the events of Ahaziah’s reign, including his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
