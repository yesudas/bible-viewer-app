This will be your confirmation that I have spoken the truth: (tn Heb “and this is your sign.” In this case the אוֹת (’ot), “sign,” is a future confirmation of God’s intervention designated before the actual intervention takes place. For similar “signs” see Exod 3:12 and Isa 7:14–25.) This year you will eat what grows wild, (sn This refers to crops that grew up on their own (that is, without cultivation) from the seed planted in past years.) and next year (tn Heb “and in the second year.”) what grows on its own from that. But in the third year you will plant seed and harvest crops; you will plant vines and consume their produce. (tn The four plural imperatival verb forms in v. 29b are used rhetorically.
