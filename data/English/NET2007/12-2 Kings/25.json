They left the city during the night. (tn The Hebrew text is abrupt here: “And all the men of war by the night.” The translation attempts to capture the sense.) They went through the gate between the two walls that is near the king’s garden. (sn The king’s garden is mentioned again in Neh 3:15 in conjunction with the pool of Siloam and the stairs that go down from the city of David. This would have been in the southern part of the city near the Tyropean Valley which agrees with the reference to the “two walls” which were probably the walls on the eastern and western hills.) (The Babylonians were all around the city.) Then they headed for the Jordan Valley. (sn Heb “toward the Arabah.” The Arabah was the rift valley north and south of the Dead Sea. Here the intention was undoubtedly to escape across the Jordan to Moab or Ammon. It appears from Jer 40:14; 41:15 that the Ammonites were known to harbor fugitives from the Babylonians.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"But the Babylonian army chased after the king.

The wall was breached in the fourth month (= early July; Jer 39:2) and Nebuzaradan came and burned the palace, the temple, and many of the houses and tore down the wall in the fifth month (= early August; Jer 52:12). That would have left time between the fifth month and the seventh month (October) to gather in the harvest of grapes, dates and figs, and olives (Jer 40:12). However, many commentators feel that too much activity takes place in too short a time for this to have been in the same year and posit that it happened the following year or even five years later when a further deportation took place, possibly in retaliation for the murder of Gedaliah and the Babylonian garrison at Mizpah (Jer 52:30). The assassination of Gedaliah had momentous consequences and was commemorated in one of the post exilic fast days lamenting the fall of Jerusalem (Zech 8:19).) Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family, (tn Heb “[was] from the seed of the kingdom.”) came with ten of his men and murdered Gedaliah, (tn Heb “and they struck down Gedaliah and he died.”) as well as the Judeans and Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah."},{"number":26,"verse":"Then all the people, from the youngest to the oldest, as well as the army officers, left for (tn Heb “arose and went to.”) Egypt, because they were afraid of what the Babylonians might do."},{"number":27,"verse":"Jehoiachin in Babylon In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, on the twenty-seventh (sn The parallel account in Jer 52:31 has “twenty-fifth.”) day of the twelfth month, (sn The twenty-seventh day would be March 22, 561 b. c. in modern reckoning.)
