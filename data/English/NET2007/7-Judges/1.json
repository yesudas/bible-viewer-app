NAB “consulted.”) the LORD, “Who should lead the invasion against the Canaanites and launch the attack?” (tn Heb “Who should first go up for us against the Canaanites to attack them?”)"},{"number":2,"verse":"The LORD said, “The men of Judah should take the lead. (tn Heb “Judah should go up.”) Be sure of this! I am handing the land over to them.” (tn The Hebrew exclamation הִנֵּה (hinneh, traditionally, “Behold”), translated “Be sure of this,” draws attention to the following statement. The verb form in the following statement (a Hebrew perfect, indicating completed action from the standpoint of the speaker) emphasizes the certainty of the event. Though it had not yet taken place, the Lord speaks of it as a “done deal.”)"},{"number":3,"verse":"The men of Judah said to their relatives, the men of Simeon, (tn Heb “Judah said to Simeon, his brother.”) “Invade our allotted land with us and help us attack the Canaanites. (tn Heb “Come up with me into our allotted land and let us attack the Canaanites.”) Then we (tn Heb “I.” The Hebrew pronoun is singular, agreeing with the collective singular “Judah” earlier in the verse. English style requires a plural pronoun here, however.) will go with you into your allotted land.” So the men of Simeon went with them."},{"number":4,"verse":"The men of Judah attacked, (tn Heb “Judah went up.”) and the LORD handed the Canaanites and Perizzites over to them.

They defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites."},{"number":6,"verse":"When Adoni-Bezek ran away, they chased him and captured him. Then they cut off his thumbs and big toes."},{"number":7,"verse":"Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings, with thumbs and big toes cut off, used to lick up (tn Elsewhere this verb usually carries the sense of “to gather; to pick up; to glean,” but “lick up” seems best here in light of the peculiar circumstances described by Adoni-Bezek.) food scraps (tn The words “food scraps” are not in the Hebrew text, but are implied.) under my table. God has repaid me for what I did to them.” (tn Heb “Just as I did, so God has repaid me.” Note that the phrase “to them” has been supplied in the translation to clarify what is meant.) They brought him to Jerusalem, (map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) where he died."},{"number":8,"verse":"The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it.

They killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai."},{"number":11,"verse":"From there they attacked the people of Debir. (tn Heb “they went from there against the inhabitants of Debir.” The LXX reads the verb as “they went up,” which suggests that the Hebrew text translated by the LXX read וַיַּעַל (vayya’al) rather than the MT’s וַיֵּלֶךְ (vayyelekh). It is possible that this is the text to be preferred in v. 11. Cf. Josh 15:15.)

The LXX has “he [Othniel] urged her to ask her father for a field.” This appears to be an attempt to reconcile the apparent inconsistency and probably does not reflect the original text. If Caleb is understood as the referent of the pronoun, the problem disappears. For a fuller discussion of the issue, see P. G. Mosca, “Who Seduced Whom? A Note on Joshua 15:18 // Judges 1:14,” CBQ 46 (1984): 18-22. The translation takes Caleb to be the referent, specified as “her father.”) so she could ask him for some land. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb said to her, “What would you like?”"},{"number":15,"verse":"She answered, “Please give me a special present.

Since you have given me land in the Negev, now give me springs of water.” So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs.

NRSV).)"},{"number":16,"verse":"Now the descendants of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the City of Date Palm Trees to Arad in the desert of Judah, (tc Part of the Greek ms tradition lacks the words “of Judah.”) located in the Negev. (tn Heb “[to] the Desert of Judah in the Negev, Arad.”) They went and lived with the people of Judah. (tn The phrase “of Judah” is supplied here in the translation. Some ancient textual witnesses read, “They went and lived with the Amalekites.” This reading, however, is probably influenced by 1 Sam 15:6 (see also Num 24:20–21).)"},{"number":17,"verse":"The men of Judah went with their brothers the men of Simeon (tn Heb “Judah went with Simeon, his brother.”) and defeated the Canaanites living in Zephath. They wiped out Zephath. (tn Heb “it”; the referent (the city of Zephath) has been specified in the translation for clarity.) So people now call the city Hormah. (sn The name Hormah (חָרְמָה, khormah) sounds like the Hebrew verb translated “wipe out” (חָרַם, kharam).)"},{"number":18,"verse":"The men of Judah captured Gaza, Ashkelon, Ekron, and the territory surrounding each of these cities.

They conquered (tn Or “seized possession of”; or “occupied.”) the hill country, but they could not (tc Several textual witnesses support the inclusion of this verb.) conquer the people living in the coastal plain, because they had chariots with iron-rimmed wheels.
