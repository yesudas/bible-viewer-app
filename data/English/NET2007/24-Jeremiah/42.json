The title “the Maacathite” would identify the locality from which his father came, i. e., a region in northern Transjordan east of Lake Huleh. Many think he is also the same man who is named “Azariah” in Jer 43:2 (the Greek version has Azariah both here and in 43:2).

There were other Judeans still left in the land of Judah who had not been killed or deported by the Babylonians.) For, as you yourself can see, there are only a few of us left out of the many there were before.

The form looks like the infinitive absolute of the verb שׁוּב (shuv), but all the versions interpret it as though it is from יָשַׁב (yashav) which is the root of the verb that follows it.

The starvation you are worried about will follow you there to (tn Or “will follow you right into Egypt,” or “will dog your steps all the way to Egypt”; Heb “cling after.” This is the only case of this verb with this preposition in the Qal stem. However, it is used with this preposition several times in the Hiphil, all with the meaning of “to pursue closely.” See BDB 180 s. v. דָּבַק Hiph.2 and compare Judg 20:45; 1 Sam 14:22; 1 Chr 10:2.) Egypt. You will die there. (tn The repetition of the adverb “there” in the translation of vv. 14, 16 is to draw attention to the rhetorical emphasis on the locale of Egypt in the original text of both v. 14 and v. 16. In v. 14 they say, “to the land of Egypt we will go…and there we will live.” In v. 16 God says, “wars…there will catch up with you…the hunger…there will follow after you…and there you will die.” God rhetorically denies their focus on Egypt as a place of safety and of relative prosperity. That can only be found in Judah under the protective presence of the Lord (vv. 10–12).)"},{"number":17,"verse":"All the people who are determined to go and settle in Egypt will die from war, starvation, or disease.

The substitution “of this:” for “that” has been made to shorten the sentence in conformity with contemporary English style.) here and now. (tn Heb “today.”)"},{"number":20,"verse":"You are making a fatal mistake. (tn Heb “you are erring at the cost of your own lives” (BDB 1073 s. v. תָּעָה Hiph.3 and HALOT 1626 s. v. תָּעָה Hif 4, and cf. BDB 90 s. v. בְּ 3 and see parallels in 1 Kgs 2:23; 2 Sam 23:17 for the nuance of “at the cost of your lives”). This fits the context better than “you are deceiving yourselves” (KBL 1035 s. v. תָּעָה Hif 4). The reading here follows the Qere הִתְעֵיתֶם (hit’etem) rather than the Kethib which has a metathesis of י (yod) and ת (tav), i. e., הִתְעֵתֶים. The Greek text presupposes הֲרֵעֹתֶם (hare’otem, “you have done evil”), but that reading is generally rejected as secondary.) For you sent me to the LORD your God and asked me, ‘Pray to the LORD our God for us. Tell us what the LORD our God says and we will do it.’ (tn Heb “According to all which the Lord our God says so tell us and we will do.” The restructuring of the sentence is intended to better reflect contemporary English style.)"},{"number":21,"verse":"This day (tn Or “Today.”) I have told you what he said. (tn The words “what he said” are not in the text but are implicit and seem necessary for clarity.) But you do not want to obey the LORD by doing what he sent me to tell you. (tn Heb “But you have not hearkened to the voice of [idiomatic for “obeyed” see BDB 1034 s. v. שָׁמַע Qal.1. m] the Lord your God, namely [cf. BDB 252 s. v. וְ 1. b] with respect [cf. BDB 514 s. v. לְ 5. f(c)] all which he has sent to us.” The verb is translated “don’t seem to want to obey” because they have not yet expressed their refusal or their actual disobedience. Several commentaries sensing this apparent discrepancy suggest that 42:19–22 are to be transposed after 43:1–3 (see, e. g., BHS note 18a, W. L. Holladay, Jeremiah [Hermeneia], 2:275; J. Bright, Jeremiah [AB], 252, 256, 258). However, there is absolutely no textual evidence for the transposition and little reason to suspect an early scribal error (in spite of Holladay’s suggestion). It is possible that Jeremiah here anticipates this answer in 43:1–3 through the response on their faces (so Bright, 256; F. B. Huey, Jeremiah, Lamentations [NAC], 361). G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (Jeremiah 26–52 [WBC], 249) also call attention to the stated intention in 41:17 and the fact that the strong warning in 42:15–17 seems to imply that a negative response is expected). The use of the perfect here is perhaps to be related to the perfect expressing resolve or determination (see IBHS 489 §30.5.1d). It is also conceivable that these two verses are part of a conditional sentence which has no formal introduction. I. e., “And if you will not obey…then you should know for certain that…” For examples of this kind of conditional clause introduced by two vavs (ו) see Joüon 2:628-29 §167. b, and compare Jer 18:4; Judg 6:13. However, though this interpretation is within the possibilities of Hebrew grammar, I know of no translation or commentary that follows it. So it has not been followed in the translation or given as an alternate translation.)"},{"number":22,"verse":"So now be very sure of this: You will die from war, starvation, or disease in the place where you want to go and live.”"}]}
