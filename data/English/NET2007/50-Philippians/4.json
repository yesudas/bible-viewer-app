Again I say, rejoice!"},{"number":5,"verse":"Let everyone see your gentleness. (tn Grk “let your gentleness be seen by all.” The passive voice construction has been converted to active voice in the translation for stylistic reasons.) The Lord is near!"},{"number":6,"verse":"Do not be anxious about anything. Instead, in every situation, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, tell your requests to God."},{"number":7,"verse":"And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds (tn Grk “will guard the hearts of you and the minds of you.” To improve the English style, the second occurrence of ὑμῶν (Jumwn, “of you”) has not been translated, since it is somewhat redundant in English.) in Christ Jesus."},{"number":8,"verse":"Finally, brothers and sisters, (tn Grk “brothers.” See note on the phrase “brothers and sisters” in 1:12.) whatever is true, whatever is worthy of respect, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if something is excellent or praiseworthy, think about these things."},{"number":9,"verse":"And what you learned and received and heard and saw in me, do these things.

NRSV “The friends”; CEV “The Lord’s followers”) If “brothers” refers to Paul’s traveling companions, it is probably that only men are in view (cf. NAB, NLT).

Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding ἀμήν in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, ἀμήν is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Thus, on internal grounds, with sufficient support from external evidence, the preferred reading is the omission of ἀμήν.)"}]}
