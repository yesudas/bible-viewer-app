The external evidence is somewhat in favor of the first person pronoun and verb; the internal evidence weighs in even stronger. In light of the parallel in 1 Cor 3:16, where Paul uses ἐστε (“you are the temple of God”), as well as the surrounding context here in which the second person verb or pronoun is used in vv. 14, 17, and 18, the second person reading seems obviously motivated. The first person reading can explain the rise of the other reading, but the reverse is not as easily done. Consequently, the first person reading of ἡμεῖς…ἐσμεν has all the credentials of authenticity.) the temple of the living God, just as God said, “I will live in them (tn Or “live among them,” “live with them.” sn I will live in them. The OT text that lies behind this passage (Lev 26:11–12) speaks of God dwelling in the midst of his people. The Greek preposition en in the phrase en autoi\" (“in them”) can also have that meaning (“among” or “with”). However, Paul appears to be extending the imagery here to involve God (as the Spirit) dwelling in his people, since he calls believers “the temple of the living God” in the previous clause, imagery he uses elsewhere in his writings (1 Cor 3:16; Eph 2:21–22).) and will walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.” (sn A quotation from Lev 26:12; also similar to Jer 32:38; Ezek 37:27.)"},{"number":17,"verse":"Therefore “come out from their midst, and be separate,” says the Lord, “and touch no unclean thing, (sn A quotation from Isa 52:11.) and I will welcome (tn Or “will receive.”) you, (sn A paraphrased quotation from Ezek 20:41.)"},{"number":18,"verse":"and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,” (sn A paraphrased quotation from 2 Sam 7:14 and Isa 43:6.) says the All-Powerful Lord.
