For clarity this was converted to an active construction with God as subject in the translation.) we do not become discouraged.

BDAG notes that “‘servant’ for ‘slave’ is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times…in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished” (BDAG 260 s. v.). The most accurate translation is “bondservant” (sometimes found in the ASV for δοῦλος), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.) for Jesus’ sake."},{"number":6,"verse":"For God, who said “Let light shine out of darkness,” (sn An allusion to Gen 1:3; see also Isa 9:2.) is the one who shined in our hearts to give us the light of the glorious knowledge (tn Grk “the light of the knowledge of the glory”; δόξης (doxhs) has been translated as an attributive genitive.) of God in the face of Christ. (tc ‡ Most witnesses, including several early and important ones (Ì46 א C H Ψ 0209 1739c Ï sy), read ᾿Ιησοῦ Χριστοῦ (Ihsou Cristou, “Jesus Christ”), while other important witnesses, especially of the Western text (D F G 0243 630 1739* 1881 lat Ambst), have Χριστοῦ ᾿Ιησοῦ. The reading with just Χριστοῦ is found in A B 33 {sa} Tert {Or Ath Chr}. Even though the witnesses for the shorter reading are not numerous, they are weighty. And in light of the natural scribal proclivity to fill out the text, particularly with reference to divine names, as well as the discrepancy among the witnesses as to the order of the names, the simple reading Χριστοῦ seems to be the best candidate for authenticity. NA27 reads ᾿Ιησοῦ Χριστοῦ with ᾿Ιησοῦ in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.)"},{"number":7,"verse":"(An Eternal Weight of Glory) But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that the extraordinary power (tn Grk “the surpassingness of the power”; δυνάμεως (dunamew\") has been translated as an attributed genitive (“extraordinary power”).) belongs to God and does not come from us."},{"number":8,"verse":"We are experiencing trouble on every side, (tn Grk “we are hard pressed [by crowds] on every side.”) but are not crushed; we are perplexed, (tn Or “at a loss.”) but not driven to despair;"},{"number":9,"verse":"we are persecuted, but not abandoned; (tn Or “forsaken.”) we are knocked down, (tn Or “badly hurt.” It is possible to interpret καταβαλλόμενοι (kataballomenoi) here as “badly hurt”: “[we are] badly hurt, but not destroyed” (L&N 20.21).) but not destroyed,"},{"number":10,"verse":"always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus, (tn The first clause of 2 Cor 4:10 is elliptical and apparently refers to the fact that Paul was constantly in danger of dying in the same way Jesus died (by violence at least).
