Walker, “Paul’s Offer of Leniency of Christ (2 Corinthians 10:1): Populist Ideology and Rhetoric in a Pauline Letter Fragment (2 Cor 10:1–13:10)” (Ph. D. diss., University of Chicago, 1998), argues for this alternative translation for three main reasons: (1) When the two Greek nouns πραΰτης and ἐπιείκεια (prauth\" and ejpieikeia) are used together, 90% of the time the nuance is “leniency and clemency.” (2) “Leniency and clemency” has a military connotation, which is precisely what appears in the following verses. (3) 2 Cor 10–13 speaks of Paul’s sparing use of his authority, which points to the nuance of “leniency and clemency.”) of Christ (I who am meek (tn Or “who lack confidence.”) when present among (tn Or “when face to face with.”) you, but am full of courage (tn Or “but bold.”) toward you when away!) —"},{"number":2,"verse":"now I ask that when I am present I may not have to be bold with the confidence that (I expect) I will dare to use against some who consider us to be behaving (tn Grk “consider us as walking.”) according to human standards.
