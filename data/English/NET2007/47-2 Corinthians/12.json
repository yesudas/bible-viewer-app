In Luke 23:43 it refers to the abode of the righteous dead. In Rev 2:7 it refers to the restoration of Edenic paradise predicted in Isa 51:3 and Ezek 36:35. The reference here in 2 Cor 12:4 is probably to be translated as parallel to the mention of the “third heaven” in v. 2. Assuming that the “first heaven” would be atmospheric heaven (the sky) and “second heaven” the more distant stars and planets, “third heaven” would refer to the place where God dwells. This is much more likely than some variation on the seven heavens mentioned in the pseudepigraphic book 2 Enoch and in other nonbiblical and rabbinic works.) and heard things too sacred to be put into words, (tn Or “things that cannot be put into words.”) things that a person (tn Grk “a man.”) is not permitted to speak."},{"number":5,"verse":"On behalf of such an individual I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except about my weaknesses."},{"number":6,"verse":"For even if I wish to boast, I will not be a fool, for I would be telling (tn Or “speaking.”) the truth, but I refrain from this so that no one may regard (tn Or “may think of.”) me beyond what he sees in me or what he hears from me,"},{"number":7,"verse":"even because of the extraordinary character of the revelations.

Internally, its case is equally strong in that its inclusion is grammatically rough (διό is hardly necessary to convey purpose, especially since Paul uses ἵνα [{ina, “so that”] next).) so that I would not become arrogant, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to trouble (tn Or “to harass.”) me — so that I would not become arrogant. (tn The phrase “so that I might not become arrogant” is repeated here because it occurs in the Greek text two times in the verse. Although redundant, it is repeated because of the emphatic nature of its affirmation.)"},{"number":8,"verse":"I asked the Lord three times about this, that it would depart from me."},{"number":9,"verse":"But (tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “but” because of the contrast implicit in the context.) he said to me, “My grace is enough (tn Or “is sufficient.”) for you, for my (tc The majority of later mss (א2 Ac D1 Ψ 0243 0278 33 1739 1881 Ï) as well as some versional witnesses include the pronoun “my” here, but the omission of the pronoun has excellent external support (Ì46vid א* A* B D* F G latt). Scribes probably added the pronoun for clarity, making the obvious referent explicit. This would also make “power” more parallel with “my grace.” Though the original text probably did not include “my,” scribes who added the word were following the sense of Paul’s statement. tn The pronoun “my” was supplied in the translation to clarify the sense of Paul’s expression.) power is made perfect (tn Or “my power comes to full strength.”) in weakness.” So then, I will boast most gladly (tn “Most gladly,” a comparative form used with superlative meaning and translated as such.) about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may reside in (tn Or “may rest on.”) me."},{"number":10,"verse":"Therefore I am content with (tn Or “I take delight in.”) weaknesses, with insults, with troubles, with persecutions and difficulties (tn Or “calamities.”) for the sake of Christ, for whenever I am weak, then I am strong."},{"number":11,"verse":"The Signs of an Apostle I have become a fool.

His point is that children should not have to pay their parent’s way.) to save up for their parents, but parents for their children."},{"number":15,"verse":"Now I will most gladly spend and be spent for your lives!

Direct objects were often omitted in Greek when clear from the context, and must be supplied for the modern reader.) and I sent our (tn Grk “the.”) brother along with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? (tn The Greek construction anticipates a negative answer, indicated by the ‘tag’ question “did he?” at the end of the clause.) Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit? Did we not behave in the same way? (tn Grk “[Did we not walk] in the same tracks?” This is an idiom that means to imitate someone else or to behave as they do.

If Titus did not take advantage of the Corinthians, then neither did Paul.)"},{"number":19,"verse":"Have you been thinking all this time (tc The reading “all this time” (πάλαι, palai) is found in several early and important Alexandrian and Western witnesses including א* A B F G 0243 6 33 81 365 1175 1739 1881 lat; the reading πάλιν (palin, “again”) is read by א2 D Ψ 0278 Ï sy bo; the reading οὐ πάλαι (ou palai) is read by Ì46, making the question even more emphatic. The reading of Ì46 could only have arisen from πάλαι. The reading πάλιν is significantly easier (“are you once again thinking that we are defending ourselves?”), for it softens Paul’s tone considerably. It thus seems to be a motivated reading and cannot easily explain the rise of πάλαι.
