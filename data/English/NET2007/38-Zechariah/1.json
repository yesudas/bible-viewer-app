This is two months later than the date of Haggai’s first message to the same community (cf. Hag 1:1).) the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah, (sn Both Ezra (5:1; 6:14) and Nehemiah (12:16) speak of Zechariah as a son of Iddo only. A probable explanation is that Zechariah’s actual father Berechiah had died and the prophet was raised by his grandfather Iddo. The “Zechariah son of Barachiah” of whom Jesus spoke (Matt 23:35; Luke 11:51) was probably the martyred prophet by that name who may have been a grandson of the priest Jehoiada (2 Chr 24:20–22).) son of Berechiah son of Iddo, as follows:"},{"number":2,"verse":"The LORD was very angry with your ancestors.

The LORD who rules over all (sn The epithet Lord who rules over all occurs frequently as a divine title throughout Zechariah (53 times total). This name (יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת, yÿhvah tsÿva’ot), traditionally translated “Lord of hosts” (so KJV, NAB, NASB; cf. NIV, NLT “Lord Almighty”; NCV, CEV “Lord All-Powerful”), emphasizes the majestic sovereignty of the Lord, an especially important concept in the postexilic world of great human empires and rulers. For a thorough study of the divine title, see T. N. D. Mettinger, In Search of God, 123-57.) says, “Turn (tn The Hebrew verb שׁוּב (shuv) is common in covenant contexts. To turn from the Lord is to break the covenant and to turn to him (i. e., to repent) is to renew the covenant relationship (cf. 2 Kgs 17:13).) to me,” says the LORD who rules over all, “and I will turn to you,” says the LORD who rules over all."},{"number":4,"verse":"“Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the former prophets called out, saying, ‘The LORD who rules over all says, “Turn now from your evil wickedness,”’ but they would by no means obey me,” says the LORD."},{"number":5,"verse":"“As for your ancestors, where are they? And did the prophets live forever?"},{"number":6,"verse":"But have my words and statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, not outlived your fathers? (tc BHS suggests אֶתְכֶם (’etkhem, “you”) for the MT אֲבֹתֵיכֶם (’avotekhem, “your fathers”) to harmonize with v. 4. In v. 4 the ancestors would not turn but in v. 6 they appear to have done so. The subject in v. 6, however, is to be construed as Zechariah’s own listeners.) Then they paid attention (tn Heb “they turned” (so ASV). Many English versions have “they repented” here; cf.

NAB “the driver of a red horse.”) on a red horse that stood among some myrtle trees (tc The LXX presupposes הֶהָרִים (heharim, “mountains”) rather than the MT הַהֲדַסִּים (hahadassim, “myrtles”), probably because of reference to the ravine. The MT reading is preferred and is followed by most English versions.) in the ravine. Behind him were red, sorrel, (sn The Hebrew שְׂרֻקִּים (sÿruqqim) means “red” (cf. NIV, NCV, NLT “brown”). English translations such as “speckled” (KJV) or “dappled” (TEV) are based on the reading of the LXX (ψαροί) that attempts to bring the color of this horse into conformity with those described in Zech 6:2–3.

Jer 25:1; 28:1; 29:10; Dan 9:2).

NAB “the complacent nations.” Here it suggests that the nations take for granted that God will never punish them just because he hasn't already done so. Thus they presume on the grace and patience of the Lord. The translation attempts to bring out this nuance rather than the more neutral renderings of TEV “nations that enjoy quiet and peace” or NLT “enjoy peace and security.”) I was a little displeased with them, but they have only made things worse for themselves."},{"number":16,"verse":"(The Oracle of Response) “‘Therefore,’ says the LORD, ‘I have become compassionate (tn Heb “I have turned.” This suggests that the Lord has responded to the “turning” (i. e., repentance) of the people (v. 6) and now, with great love and forgiveness, allows construction of the temple to proceed.) toward Jerusalem (map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.) and will rebuild my temple (tn Heb “house.”) in it,’ says the LORD who rules over all. ‘Once more a surveyor’s measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.’"},{"number":17,"verse":"Speak up again with the message of the LORD who rules over all: ‘My cities will once more overflow with prosperity, and once more the LORD will comfort Zion and validate his choice of Jerusalem.’”"},{"number":18,"verse":"(Vision Two: The Four Horns) (2:1) (sn This marks the beginning of ch. 2 in the Hebrew text.
