It is unlikely that diamond was known to ancient Israel, however, so probably a hard stone like emery or corundum is in view. The translation nevertheless uses “diamond” because in modern times it has become proverbial for its hardness. A number of English versions use “flint” here (e. g., NASB, NIV).) so that they could not obey the Torah and the other words the LORD who rules over all had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets.

TEV “This good land”).) land a waste.”"}]}
