There is a remarkable concentration of this name of God in this section of Zechariah. Of 53 occurrences of יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת (yÿhvah tsÿva’ot) in the Hebrew text in the book, 18 are in this chapter. The reason is the sheer human impossibility of accomplishing what lies ahead – it must be done by the Lord who rules over all.) came to me as follows:"},{"number":2,"verse":"“The LORD who rules over all says, ‘I am very much concerned for Zion; indeed, I am so concerned for her that my rage will fall on those who hurt her.’"},{"number":3,"verse":"The Lord says, ‘I have returned to Zion and will live within Jerusalem.

Isa 65:20; Jer 31:12–13).)"},{"number":6,"verse":"And,’ says the LORD who rules over all, ‘though such a thing may seem to be difficult in the opinion of the small community of those days, will it also appear difficult to me?’ asks the LORD who rules over all."},{"number":7,"verse":"“The LORD who rules over all asserts, ‘I am about to save my people from the lands of the east and the west."},{"number":8,"verse":"And I will bring them to settle within Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God, (sn The affirmation They will be my people, and I will be their God speaks of covenant renewal, a restoration of the unbroken fellowship the Lord desired to have with his people but which their disloyalty had shattered. In the eschaton God and Israel will be in covenant union once again (cf. Jer 31:33).) in truth and righteousness.’"},{"number":9,"verse":"“The LORD who rules over all also says, ‘Gather strength, you who are listening to these words today from the mouths of the prophets who were there at the founding of the house of the LORD who rules over all, (sn These prophets who were there at the founding of the house of the Lord who rules over all included at least Haggai and Zechariah, and perhaps others. The founding referred to here is not the initial laying of the temple’s foundations in 536 b. c.

NCV, CEV “punish”). God may bring hurt but its purpose is redemptive and/or pedagogical.) you when your fathers made me angry,’ says the LORD who rules over all, ‘and I was not sorry,"},{"number":15,"verse":"so, to the contrary, I have planned in these days to do good to Jerusalem and Judah — do not fear!"},{"number":16,"verse":"These are the things you must do: Speak the truth, each of you, to one another.
