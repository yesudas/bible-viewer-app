But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband."},{"number":3,"verse":"So then ((Matt. 5:32)) if, while her husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she has married another man."},{"number":4,"verse":"Therefore, my brethren, you also have become (Rom. 8:2; Gal. 2:19; 5:18; (Col. 2:14)) dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another—to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should (Gal. 5:22) bear fruit to God."},{"number":5,"verse":"For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were aroused by the law (Rom. 6:13) were at work in our members (Rom. 6:21; Gal. 5:19; James 1:15) to bear fruit to death."},{"number":6,"verse":"But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve (Rom. 2:29; 2 Cor. 3:6) in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter."},{"number":7,"verse":"(Sin’s Advantage in the Law) What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, (Rom. 3:20) I would not have known sin except through the law.

Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful."},{"number":14,"verse":"For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, (1 Kin. 21:20, 25; 2 Kin. 17:17; Rom. 6:16) sold under sin."},{"number":15,"verse":"For what I am doing, I do not understand.
