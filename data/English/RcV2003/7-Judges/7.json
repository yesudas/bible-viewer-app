And the camp of Midian was to their north, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley."},{"number":2,"verse":"And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people with you are too many for Me to deliver Midian into their hand; Israel might vaunt himself against Me, saying, My own hand has saved me."},{"number":3,"verse":"Now then proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, Whoever is afraid and trembling should return and depart from here. And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then Jehovah said to Gideon, The people are still too many. Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. And he of whom I say to you, This one shall go with you, he shall go with you. And every one of whom I say to you, This one shall not go with you, he shall not go."},{"number":5,"verse":"So he brought the people down to the water.

So he went down with Purah his young man to the edge of the battle array that was in the camp."},{"number":12,"verse":"Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay in the valley like a locust swarm in multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand on the seashore is in multitude."},{"number":13,"verse":"And when Gideon came, at that moment a man was recounting a dream to his companion; and he said, I have just had a dream. There was this round loaf of barley bread tumbling through the camp of Midian. And it came to the tent and struck it, so that it fell and turned upside down. And the tent collapsed."},{"number":14,"verse":"And his companion answered and said, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has delivered Midian and all the camp into his hand."},{"number":15,"verse":"And when Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he worshipped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, Arise, for Jehovah has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand."},{"number":16,"verse":"And he divided the three hundred men into three companies; and he put trumpets into the hands of them all, as well as empty pitchers, with torches inside the pitchers."},{"number":17,"verse":"And he said to them, Look at me, and do as I do.

And they cried out, A sword for Jehovah and for Gideon!"},{"number":21,"verse":"And each man stood in his place around the camp. Then the whole camp ran off, and they shouted and fled."},{"number":22,"verse":"And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and Jehovah set each manâ€™s sword against his companion and against the whole camp. And the camp fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the edge of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath."},{"number":23,"verse":"And the men of Israel were called up from Naphtali and from Asher and from all of Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian."},{"number":24,"verse":"Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and seize the waters against them as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan. And every man of Ephraim was called up, and they seized the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan."},{"number":25,"verse":"And they captured two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And they slew Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine press of Zeeb; and they pursued Midian. And they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan."}]}
