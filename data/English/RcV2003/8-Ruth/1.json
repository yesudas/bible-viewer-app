And they dwelt there about ten years."},{"number":5,"verse":"And both Mahlon and Chilion died, and the woman was left without her two children and her husband."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then she rose up with her daughters-in-law in order to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that Jehovah had visited His people by giving them food."},{"number":7,"verse":"So she went forth from the place where she had been, along with her two daughters-in-law; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah."},{"number":8,"verse":"And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go and return, each of you, to your mother’s house.

If I said, I have hope; even if I had a husband tonight and even bore sons;"},{"number":13,"verse":"Would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having a husband? No, my daughters; it has been far more bitter for me than it should be for you, for the hand of Jehovah has gone forth against me."},{"number":14,"verse":"And they lifted up their voice and wept again.

And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest."}]}
