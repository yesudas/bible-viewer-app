And I saw in the vision, and I was at the Ulai canal."},{"number":3,"verse":"I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last."},{"number":4,"verse":"I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great."},{"number":5,"verse":"As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground.

Without warning he shall destroy many. And he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, and he shall be broken- but by no human hand."},{"number":26,"verse":"The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true, but seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now.\""},{"number":27,"verse":"And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days. Then I rose and went about the king's business, but I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it."}]}
