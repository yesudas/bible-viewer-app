What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable."},{"number":43,"verse":"It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power."},{"number":44,"verse":"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body."},{"number":45,"verse":"Thus it is written, \"The first man Adam became a living being\"; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit."},{"number":46,"verse":"But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual."},{"number":47,"verse":"The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven."},{"number":48,"verse":"As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven."},{"number":49,"verse":"Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven."},{"number":50,"verse":"I tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable."},{"number":51,"verse":"Behold!
