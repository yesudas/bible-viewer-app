The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up."},{"number":6,"verse":"Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?"},{"number":7,"verse":"If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played?"},{"number":8,"verse":"And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?"},{"number":9,"verse":"So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air."},{"number":10,"verse":"There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning,"},{"number":11,"verse":"but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me."},{"number":12,"verse":"So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church."},{"number":13,"verse":"Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret."},{"number":14,"verse":"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful."},{"number":15,"verse":"What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also."},{"number":16,"verse":"Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say \"Amen\" to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying?"},{"number":17,"verse":"For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up."},{"number":18,"verse":"I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you."},{"number":19,"verse":"Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue."},{"number":20,"verse":"Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature."},{"number":21,"verse":"In the Law it is written, \"By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.\""},{"number":22,"verse":"Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers."},{"number":23,"verse":"If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds?"},{"number":24,"verse":"But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all,"},{"number":25,"verse":"the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you."},{"number":26,"verse":"What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up."},{"number":27,"verse":"If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret."},{"number":28,"verse":"But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God."},{"number":29,"verse":"Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said."},{"number":30,"verse":"If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent."},{"number":31,"verse":"For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged,"},{"number":32,"verse":"and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets."},{"number":33,"verse":"For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,"},{"number":34,"verse":"the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says."},{"number":35,"verse":"If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church."},{"number":36,"verse":"Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached?"},{"number":37,"verse":"If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord."},{"number":38,"verse":"If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized."},{"number":39,"verse":"So, my brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues."},{"number":40,"verse":"But all things should be done decently and in order."}]}
