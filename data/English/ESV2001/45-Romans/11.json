For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin."},{"number":2,"verse":"God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel?"},{"number":3,"verse":"\"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.\""},{"number":4,"verse":"But what is God's reply to him? \"I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.\""},{"number":5,"verse":"So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace."},{"number":6,"verse":"But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace."},{"number":7,"verse":"What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,"},{"number":8,"verse":"as it is written, \"God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day.\""},{"number":9,"verse":"And David says, \"Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;"},{"number":10,"verse":"let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever.\""},{"number":11,"verse":"So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous."},{"number":12,"verse":"Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!"},{"number":13,"verse":"Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry"},{"number":14,"verse":"in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them."},{"number":15,"verse":"For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?"},{"number":16,"verse":"If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches."},{"number":17,"verse":"But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree,"},{"number":18,"verse":"do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you."},{"number":19,"verse":"Then you will say, \"Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\""},{"number":20,"verse":"That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe."},{"number":21,"verse":"For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you."},{"number":22,"verse":"Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off."},{"number":23,"verse":"And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again."},{"number":24,"verse":"For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree."},{"number":25,"verse":"Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in."},{"number":26,"verse":"And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, \"The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob\";"},{"number":27,"verse":"\"and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\""},{"number":28,"verse":"As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers."},{"number":29,"verse":"For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable."},{"number":30,"verse":"Just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,"},{"number":31,"verse":"so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy."},{"number":32,"verse":"For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all."},{"number":33,"verse":"Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!"},{"number":34,"verse":"\"For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?\""},{"number":35,"verse":"\"Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?\""},{"number":36,"verse":"For from him and through him and to him are all things.
