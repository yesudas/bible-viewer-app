In that message Jeremiah had written that Jerusalem would be destroyed and remain ruined for seventy years."},{"number":3,"verse":"After I read that, I pleaded to Yahweh my God to help us, praying and ◄fasting/abstaining from eating food►. While doing that, I was wearing rough cloth and sitting in ashes to show that I was very sad about what had happened to us."},{"number":4,"verse":"I confessed the sins that we had committed, and this is what I prayed: Lord, you are great and awesome! You have faithfully done what you said that you would do for us. You faithfully love those who love you and who do what you have commanded that they should do."},{"number":5,"verse":"But we Israelis have sinned. We have done things that are wrong. We have done wicked things, and we have rebelled against you. We have turned away from obeying your commands [DOU]."},{"number":6,"verse":"Your prophets spoke for you [MTY], giving your messages to our kings, to our other rulers, to our other ancestors, and to all the Israeli people, but we have refused to ◄pay attention to/heed► those prophets."},{"number":7,"verse":"Lord, you always do what is righteous/just/fair, but we have caused ourselves to be ashamed [IDI]. This is still true about all of the Israelis who live in Jerusalem and who live in other places in Judea.

But Yahweh our God, we still have not tried, by turning away from our sinning and by heeding your truth, to persuade you to act mercifully toward us."},{"number":14,"verse":"So, because we did not obey you, you prepared to punish us, and then you did punish us, because you always do what is righteous/just/fair."},{"number":15,"verse":"Lord our God, you brought your people out of Egypt by your great power [MTY], and by doing that you have caused people from that time until the present time to know that you are great [IDI] even though we have sinned and done wicked things."},{"number":16,"verse":"Lord, Jerusalem is your city, and your temple was built there on your sacred hill.

He loves you very much, so he has sent me to tell you what he said to me. So now ◄pay attention/listen carefully► in order that you may understand the meaning of what he revealed to Jeremiah."},{"number":24,"verse":"God has determined/declared that there will be 490 years until he frees/saves your people from the guilt of their sins and to atone for the evil things that they have done.

Then 434 years later, Jerusalem will be rebuilt, and it will have streets and will have a ◄moat/deep ditch filled with water► around it to protect the city. But that will be a time when God's people have a lot of troubles/difficulties/suffering."},{"number":26,"verse":"After those 434 years, the leader/king whom God has appointed will be killed ◄unjustly/without having done anything wrong►. After that, the temple will be destroyed by the army of a powerful ruler. The city and the temple will be destroyed like a flood [MET] destroys everything. That will be the beginning of the war and destruction that God has decreed will happen."},{"number":27,"verse":"That ruler will make a strong agreement with many people. He will promise to do for seven years what he has said in that agreement. But when that time is half finished, he will prevent priests from giving any more offerings and sacrifices to God. A disgusting idol will be put on the highest part of the temple, and it will stay there until God gets rid of the one who put it there, which is what he said that he would do.”"}]}
