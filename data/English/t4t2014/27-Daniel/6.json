Because of that, the king planned to appoint me to be in charge of the entire empire."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then, the other administrators and the governors became jealous. So they began to search to find something that they could criticize about the way I was working for the king. But I always did my work faithfully and honestly, and was never lazy. So they could not find anything to criticize."},{"number":5,"verse":"They concluded, “The only way we can find something for which we can criticize Daniel will be something concerning the laws that his god his given him.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"So the administrators and governors went as one group to the king and said, “◄Your Majesty/O king►, we wish that you will live a long time!"},{"number":7,"verse":"We administrators and governors and district governors and advisors and other officials have all agreed that you should make a law that everyone must obey.

He called out, “Daniel, you who serve the all-powerful God! Was your God, whom you worship regularly, able to save you from the lions?”"},{"number":21,"verse":"I answered, “◄Your Majesty/O king►, I hope that you will live a long time!"},{"number":22,"verse":"Yes, my God sent his angel to shut the lions' mouths, in order that they would not harm me!

When they did that, they saw that the lions had not wounded me at all. God had protected me because I trusted in him."},{"number":24,"verse":"Then the king commanded that the men who had accused me should be seized and be thrown, along with their wives and children, into the pit where the lions were. When they were thrown into the pit, the lions leaped on them and crushed their bones before they fell onto the bottom of the pit!"},{"number":25,"verse":"Then King Darius wrote this message and sent it throughout his kingdom to the people of every people-group and nation and from all language groups: “I wish/hope that all things go very well with you!"},{"number":26,"verse":"I command that everyone in my kingdom should fear and revere the God that Daniel worships.
