As a result, the local people asked Jesus to leave the area.Jesus and his disciples arrived on the east side of Lake Galilee. They landed near where the Gerasene people lived."},{"number":2,"verse":"There was a man in that region whom evil spirits controlled."},{"number":3,"verse":"Because that man was violent and people were afraid of him, they had tied him up many times. As he grew more violent, no one was able to tie him up any longer, not even with chains,"},{"number":4,"verse":"because the chains would be broken by him {he would break the chains} whenever he was bound {they bound him} with them. The iron shackles would also be smashed by him {He would also smash the iron shackles} whenever they were fastened {they fastened them} on his feet."},{"number":5,"verse":"He lived in one of the caves where they bury dead people. During both night and day he would scream among the caves and in the hills. He would also cut himself with sharp stones.

He immediately ran to Jesus, and then he knelt before him."},{"number":7,"verse":"Jesus had been saying to the evil spirit, “You evil spirit, come out of this man!” But the demon did not leave quickly. It shouted very loudly, “Jesus, I know that you are the Son of God, so ◄we have nothing in common./what do we have in common?► [IDM, RHQ] So leave me alone! I ask you to promise, knowing God is listening, that you will not torture me now!”"},{"number":9,"verse":"So, in order to expel the demon more easily, Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He replied, “My name is Crowd/Mob because there are many of us evil spirits in this man.”"},{"number":10,"verse":"Then the evil spirits fervently kept begging Jesus that he not send them out of the region."},{"number":11,"verse":"At the same time, a large herd of pigs was ◄grazing/rooting for food► nearby on the hillside."},{"number":12,"verse":"So the evil spirits pleaded with Jesus, “Allow us to go to the pigs in order that we might enter them!”"},{"number":13,"verse":"He permitted them to do that.

The herd, which numbered about 2,, rushed down the cliff into the lake, and then they drowned in the lake."},{"number":14,"verse":"The men who were tending the pigs ran and reported in the town and the countryside what had happened. Many people went to see what had happened."},{"number":15,"verse":"They came to the place where Jesus was. Then they saw the man whom evil spirits had previously controlled.

But although she had spent all her money to pay the doctors, she had not been helped {they had not helped her}. Instead, she had become worse [EUP]."},{"number":27,"verse":"After she heard that Jesus healed people, she came to where he was and pushed in the crowd close behind Jesus."},{"number":28,"verse":"She did that because she was thinking, “If I touch him or even if I touch his clothes, I will be healed {his power will heal me}.” So she touched Jesus' clothes."},{"number":29,"verse":"At once her bleeding stopped. At the same time, she sensed within herself that she had been cured of {that he had cured} her illness."},{"number":30,"verse":"Jesus also immediately sensed within himself that his power had healed someone. So he turned around in the crowd and then he asked, “Who touched my clothes?”"},{"number":31,"verse":"One of his disciples replied, “You can see that many people are crowding close to you!

Then she told him truthfully about what she had done."},{"number":34,"verse":"He said to her, “◄Ma'am/Young lady►, because you have believed that I could heal you, I have now healed you. You may go home with peace in your heart, because I promise that you will not be sick this way anymore.”"},{"number":35,"verse":"While Jesus was still speaking to that woman, some people arrived who had come from Jairus' house. They said to Jairus, “Your daughter has now died. So ◄it is useless that you bother the teacher any longer by urging him to go to your house!/why do you bother the teacher any longer by urging him to go to your house?► [RHQ]”"},{"number":36,"verse":"But when Jesus heard what these men said, he said to Jairus, “Do not think that the situation is hopeless! Just keep believing that she will live!”"},{"number":37,"verse":"Then he allowed only his three closest disciples, Peter, James, and John, to go with him to Jairus' house. He did not allow any other people to go with him. After they arrived near the house, Jesus saw that the people there were in turmoil.

When this happened, all who were present were very astonished."},{"number":43,"verse":"Jesus ordered them strictly, “Do not tell anyone about what I have done!” Afterwards he told them that something to eat should be brought to her {that they should bring her something to eat}."}]}
