But some were saying, “This man is just an ordinary person like we are! So ◄we cannot believe that this man is able to teach us about these things and that he has been made very wise {that God has made him very wise} and that he is performing such miracles!/how is it that [RHQ] this man is able to teach us about these things and that he has been made very wise {that God has made him very wise} and that he is performing such miracles?► [RHQ]"},{"number":3,"verse":"◄We know that he is just an ordinary carpenter!/Isn't he just an ordinary carpenter [RHQ]?► We know him and his family! We know Mary his mother! ◄We know his younger brothers James, Joses, Judas and Simon!/Are not his younger brothers James, Joses, Judas and Simon?► [RHQ] And ◄his younger sisters also live here with us!/do not his younger sisters also live here with us?► [RHQ]” So they despised him."},{"number":4,"verse":"Jesus knew that they refused to believe in him. So he said to them, “It is certainly true that people honor me and other prophets in other places, but not in our hometowns! Even our relatives and the people who live in our own houses do not honor us!”"},{"number":5,"verse":"So, although he healed a few sick people there by touching them, he decided not to perform many other miracles in Nazareth because the people there did not believe that he was the Messiah."},{"number":6,"verse":"He was amazed that they did not believe in him. Jesus began to send out his disciples two-by-two and gave them power and instructions. Jesus and his disciples went from town to town in that region teaching the people."},{"number":7,"verse":"Jesus began to send out his disciples two-by-two and gave them power and instructions. Jesus and his disciples went from town to town in that region teaching the people.One day he summoned the twelve disciples, and then he told them that he was going to send them out two-by-two to teach people in various towns. He gave them power to expel evil spirits from people."},{"number":8,"verse":"He also instructed them to wear sandals and to take along a walking stick when they were traveling. He told them not to take food, nor a bag in which travelers carry supplies, nor any money for their journey. He also did not allow them to take extra clothing. He wanted the people who heard their message to give them what they needed."},{"number":10,"verse":"He also instructed them, “After you enter a town, if someone invites you to stay in his house, go into his house. Eat and sleep in that same home until you leave that town."},{"number":11,"verse":"Wherever the people do not welcome you and wherever the people do not listen to you, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that place.

That is why he has God's power to perform these miracles!”"},{"number":15,"verse":"Others were saying about Jesus, “He is the former prophet Elijah, whom God promised to send back again.” Others were saying about Jesus, “No, he is a different prophet, like one of the other prophets who lived long ago.”"},{"number":16,"verse":"Having heard what the people were saying, King Herod Antipas himself repeatedly said, “The man performing those miracles must be John! I commanded my soldiers to cut off his head, but he has become alive again to get revenge for my killing him!”"},{"number":17,"verse":"The reason King Herod concluded that John wanted revenge is as follows: Some time before this, Herod married Herodias, while she was still the wife of his younger brother, Philip."},{"number":18,"verse":"John kept telling Herod, “God's law does not permit you to marry the wife of your brother while he is still alive.” Then, because Herodias urged him to put John in prison, Herod himself sent soldiers to John.

But she could not do that because while John was in prison, Herod kept John safe from her."},{"number":20,"verse":"Herod did this because he respected/feared John, because he knew that he was a righteous and holy man. The king did not know what he should do, but he liked to listen to him."},{"number":21,"verse":"But Herodias was able to have someone execute John when they honored/celebrated the day when Herod was born.

She went to the king and she requested, “I want you to command someone to cut off the head of John the Baptizer and give it to me at once on a platter, so that my mother can know he is dead!”"},{"number":26,"verse":"The king became very distressed when he heard what she asked for because he knew John was a very righteous man (OR, because he now knew that he should not have made that promise to her). But he could not refuse what she requested because he had promised that he would give her anything she asked for, and because his guests had heard him promise that."},{"number":27,"verse":"So the king at once ordered the man who executes prisoners to go and cut off John's head and bring it to the girl.
