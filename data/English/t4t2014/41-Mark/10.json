Jesus answered and supported his answer from Scripture.Jesus left ◄that place/Capernaum► with his disciples, and they went through Judea district and on across to the east side of the Jordan River. When crowds gathered around him again, he taught them again, as he customarily did."},{"number":2,"verse":"While he was teaching them, some Pharisees approached him and asked him, “Does our Jewish law permit a man to divorce his wife?” They asked that in order to be able to criticize him whether he answered “yes” or “no”."},{"number":3,"verse":"He answered them, “What did Moses command your ancestors about a man divorcing his wife?”"},{"number":4,"verse":"One of them replied, “Moses permitted that a man may write on paper his reason for divorcing his wife, give this paper to her, and then send her away.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “It was because your ancestors stubbornly wanted just what they desired that Moses wrote that law for your ancestors, and you are just like them!"},{"number":6,"verse":"Remember that he also wrote that, when God first created people, he made one man, and one woman to become that man's wife."},{"number":7,"verse":"That explains why God said, ‘When a man and woman marry, they should no longer live with their fathers and mothers after they marry."},{"number":8,"verse":"Instead, the two of them shall live together, and they shall become so closely united [MET] that they are like one person.’ Therefore, although the people who marry were two separate persons before, God regards them as one person now, so he wants them to remain married."},{"number":9,"verse":"Because that is true, a man must not separate from his wife whom God has joined to him, because God's plan is for them to remain together!”"},{"number":10,"verse":"When Jesus and his disciples were alone in a house, they asked him again about this."},{"number":11,"verse":"He said to them, “God considers that a marriage lasts until either the husband or the wife dies, so he considers that any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman is committing adultery, even if he divorces his first wife."},{"number":12,"verse":"God also considers a woman who divorces her first husband to be committing adultery if she marries another man.”"},{"number":13,"verse":"Jesus became indignant when he saw his disciples scolding people for bringing children for him to bless them.One day, some people were bringing children to Jesus in order that he would touch and bless them. But the disciples scolded those people because they thought that Jesus ◄did not want to be bothered spending time with/was not concerned about► children."},{"number":14,"verse":"When Jesus saw that, he became angry. He said to the disciples, “Allow the children to come to me! Do not forbid them [DOU]! It is people who are humble and trust as they do who can experience ◄God's rule in their lives/God taking care of them► [MET]."},{"number":15,"verse":"Note this: Those who do not trustingly allow God to direct their lives, as children do, will not enter the place where God rules.”"},{"number":16,"verse":"Then he embraced the children.

So is ◄that enough/there something else that I have not done►?”"},{"number":21,"verse":"Jesus looked at him and loved him. He said to him, “There is one thing that you have not yet done. You must go home, sell all that you possess, and then give the money to poor people. As a result, you will be spiritually rich in heaven.

He went away sad, because he was very rich and he did not want to give away everything."},{"number":23,"verse":"Jesus looked around at the people. Then he exclaimed to his disciples, “It is very difficult for people who are wealthy to decide to let God rule their lives!”"},{"number":24,"verse":"The disciples were surprised at what he said. They thought that God favored the rich people, so if God did not save them, he would not save anyone. So Jesus replied again to them, “My dear friends, it is very difficult for anyone to decide to let God rule his life."},{"number":25,"verse":"It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. It is almost as difficult [HYP] for rich people to decide to let God rule their lives.”"},{"number":26,"verse":"The disciples were very astonished.

Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples/apostles were astonished that he was going to where there were many people who opposed him, and the other people who were with them were afraid about what would happen to him in Jerusalem. Along the way he took the twelve disciples to a place by themselves. Then he began to tell them again about what was going to happen to him, saying,"},{"number":33,"verse":"“Listen carefully! We are going up to Jerusalem. There the chief priests and the men who teach the Jewish laws will be enabled {someone will help the chief priests and those who teach our Jewish laws} to seize me.

Let one of us sit at your right side and one sit at your left side.”"},{"number":38,"verse":"But Jesus said to them, “You do not understand what you are asking for.” Then he asked them, “Can you endure suffering [MTY] like I am about to suffer? Can you endure being killed [MTY] as I will be killed {people killing you as they will kill me}?”"},{"number":39,"verse":"They said to him, “Yes, we are able to do that!” Then Jesus said to them, “It is true that you will endure suffering [MTY] like I will suffer, and you will endure being killed as I will be killed {people killing you as they will kill me}."},{"number":40,"verse":"But I am not the one who chooses the ones who will sit next to me and rule with me. God will give those places to the ones he appoints.”"},{"number":41,"verse":"The other ten disciples later heard about what James and John had requested. As a result, they were angry with them because they also wanted to rule with Jesus in the highest positions."},{"number":42,"verse":"Then, after Jesus called them all together, he said to them, “You know that those who rule the non-Jews enjoy showing that they are powerful. You also know that officials enjoy commanding others."},{"number":43,"verse":"But do not be like them! On the contrary, all those among you who want God to consider them great must become like servants to the rest of you."},{"number":44,"verse":"Furthermore, if anyone among you wants God to consider him to be the most important, he must act like a servant for the rest of you."},{"number":45,"verse":"You should imitate me. Even though I am the one who has come from heaven, I did not come to be served {for others to serve me}.
