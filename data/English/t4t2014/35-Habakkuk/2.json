I will wait there to find out what Yahweh will say, what he will reply to what I have complained about.”"},{"number":2,"verse":"Yahweh's second replyThen Yahweh replied to me, “Write plainly on tablets what I am revealing to you in this vision, and then read it to a messenger in order that he can run with it to tell it to other people."},{"number":3,"verse":"In this vision I will be talking about things that will happen in the future. Now is not the time when those things will happen, but they certainly will happen, and when they occur, they will occur quickly, and they will not be delayed. Now you want those things to happen immediately, but they are not happening. But wait patiently for them to happen!"},{"number":4,"verse":"Think about the proud people of Babylonia! They are certainly not doing what is righteous. But people who are righteous will live because they faithfully do what I want them to do."},{"number":5,"verse":"If people trust in their wealth, they will deceive themselves, and proud people are never able to rest. It is as though the greedy people of Babylonia open their mouths as wide as the place where dead people are, and they never have enough, like the place where dead people go never has enough dead people [PRS]. The armies of Babylonia conquer many nations for themselves, and capture all their people."},{"number":6,"verse":"But soon all those whom they have captured will ridicule the soldiers from Babylonia!

You are proud and you think that your houses will be safe because you have built them in places where you can easily defend them."},{"number":10,"verse":"But because you have destroyed others, you have caused your family [MTY] to be shamed/disgraced, and you yourselves will be killed."},{"number":11,"verse":"It is as though the stones in the walls of your houses cry out to accuse you, and it is as though the beams in your ceilings also say the same things."},{"number":12,"verse":"Terrible things will happen to you people of Babylonia who kill people [MTY] in order to build cities, cities that you build by using money that you have gotten by committing crimes."},{"number":13,"verse":"But the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels has [RHQ] declared that everything that is built by people who do things like that will be destroyed by fire; they will have worked hard uselessly."},{"number":14,"verse":"But in contrast, like [SIM] the oceans are filled with water, the earth will be filled with people who know that Yahweh is very great."},{"number":15,"verse":"Terrible things will happen to you people of Babylonia who cause people who live in nearby countries to become drunk. You force them to drink a lot of wine from wineskins until they are drunk and then they walk around naked in order that you will be happy when you see that."},{"number":16,"verse":"But you are the ones who soon will be disgraced instead of being honored.
