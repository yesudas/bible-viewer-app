But after that, I will see you again. Then you will be joyful, and no one will be able to stop you from being joyful."},{"number":23,"verse":"When that happens, you will not ask me any questions about anything. Listen to this carefully: After that happens, my Father will do for you anything you ask, because of his relationship with me [MTY]."},{"number":24,"verse":"Up to the present time you have not asked God to do anything for you because of his relationship with me [MTY].
