Because we all have a close relationship with the Lord Jesus, we(exc) strongly urge you [DOU] to conduct your lives in a way that pleases God. We taught you to do that, and you know that we did that as a result of what the Lord Jesus told us to say. We know that you are conducting your lives that way, but we strongly urge that you do that even more."},{"number":3,"verse":"God wants you, by your behaving in a sexually pure way, to show that you completely belong to him.God wants you to live pure lives that will show that you completely belong to him. He wants you to avoid doing any sexually immoral acts (OR, avoid being sexually immoral in any way)."},{"number":4,"verse":"That is, he wants each one of you to know how to control your own sexual desires [EUP].

Remember that we strongly warned you previously [DOU] that the Lord Jesus will punish all people who do sexually immoral acts."},{"number":7,"verse":"When God chose us believers, he did not want us to be people who behave in a sexually immoral way. On the contrary, he wants us to be people who behave in a morally pure way."},{"number":8,"verse":"So I warn you that those who disregard this teaching of mine are not just disregarding a human being. On the contrary, they are disregarding God, because God commanded it. Remember that God sent his Spirit, who is holy, to live in you!"},{"number":9,"verse":"We urge you to increasingly love each other, to strive to work at your own occupations, and not meddle in others' affairs.I want to urge you again that you should love your fellow believers [MET].

Encourage each other by telling this message.My fellow believers, we also want you to understand well [LIT] what will happen to our fellow believers who now are dead [EUP].

Some of you may think that when the Lord Jesus comes back, he will consider that we believers who are still living will be superior to those believers who have died [EUP], because we will meet Jesus first. That is certainly not true!"},{"number":16,"verse":"It is the Lord Jesus himself who will descend from heaven. When he comes down, he will command all of us believers to rise. The chief angel will shout with a loud voice, and another angel will blow a trumpet for God.
