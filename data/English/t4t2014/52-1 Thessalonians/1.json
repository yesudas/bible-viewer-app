As a result, you inspired all the believers who are in Macedonia and Achaia to trust in God firmly, as you do.) We always thank God for you all when we mention you while we pray (OR, when we pray for you)."},{"number":3,"verse":"We thank God because we continually remember that you work for God because you trust in him and you earnestly/energetically help people because you love them.
