And it happened that she was working in a field that belonged to Boaz, the man from the clan of her dead father-in-law, Elimelech!"},{"number":4,"verse":"Just then, Boaz arrived from Bethlehem. He greeted the men who were harvesting the grain, saying, “I want Yahweh to bless you!” They replied, “We want Yahweh to bless you, too!”"},{"number":5,"verse":"Then Boaz saw Ruth, and asked the ◄foreman/man in charge of the other workmen►, “Whose daughter is that young woman?”"},{"number":6,"verse":"The foreman replied, “She is the woman from Moab who returned from there with her mother-in-law Naomi."},{"number":7,"verse":"She said to me, ‘Please let me walk behind the men who are harvesting the grain and pick up some of the grain they leave behind.'I gave her permission, and she went into the field, and she has been working from this morning until now.

Stay here with my servant girls."},{"number":9,"verse":"Watch where the men are harvesting, and follow along behind the servant girls. I will tell the men who are working not to touch/molest you.

She gathered stalks of grain until the barley harvest and the wheat harvest were finished. During that time she lived with Naomi."}]}
