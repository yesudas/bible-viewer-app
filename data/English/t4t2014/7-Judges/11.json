When they grew up, they forced Jephthah to leave home, saying to him, “You are the son of a prostitute, not the son of our mother.

While he was there, some worthless men started to spend a lot of time with him."},{"number":4,"verse":"Some time later, the Ammon people-group started to fight against the Israelis."},{"number":5,"verse":"When that happened [DOU], the leaders of the Gilead region went to Jephthah to bring him back from the Tob region to their area."},{"number":6,"verse":"They said to him, “Come with us and lead our army, and help us to fight against the men from the Ammon people-group!”"},{"number":7,"verse":"But Jephthah replied, “You hated me [RHQ] previously!

So why are you coming to me now, asking me to help you when you are experiencing trouble?”"},{"number":8,"verse":"The leaders from Gilead replied, “Yes, we are having trouble, and that is the reason that we have come to you now. If you come with us and help us to fight against the Ammon people-group, after we defeat them, we will appoint you to be the leader of all us people in the Gilead region.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"Jephthah replied, “If I go back to Gilead with you to fight against the Ammon people-group, and if Yahweh helps us to defeat them, will you truly appoint me to be your leader?”"},{"number":10,"verse":"They replied, “Yahweh is listening to everything that we say.

So you must do to me what you promised, because you said that you would do that if Yahweh helped you to defeat our enemies, the Ammon people-group.”"},{"number":37,"verse":"Then she also said, “But allow me to do one thing. ◄First/before you do what you promised►, allow me to go up into the hilly area and wander around for two months. Since I will never be married and have children, allow me and my friends to go and cry together.”"},{"number":38,"verse":"Jephthah replied, “All right, you may go.” So she left for two months. She and her friends stayed in the hills and they cried for her because she would never be married."},{"number":39,"verse":"After two months, she returned to her father Jephthah, and he did to her what he had solemnly promised. So his daughter never was married.
