Do not let anything non-Christian determine how you act, but instead let God change your way of thinking.My fellow believers, since God has acted mercifully toward you in so many ways, I appeal to all of you that you present yourselves [SYN] to him by making yourselves like holy sacrifices [MET].

Since God has done so much for you/us, this is the only appropriate way to serve him."},{"number":2,"verse":"Do not let anything non-Christian determine how you should act. Instead, let God change your way of life by making your way of thinking new, in order that you may know what he wants you to do. That is, you will know what is good, and you will know what pleases God, and you will know how to be all that he wants you to be."},{"number":3,"verse":"Do not think about yourselves more highly than you should.

May we do diligently and cheerfully what God has given us ability to do.Because God has kindly appointed me to be his apostle, which I did not deserve, I say this to every one of you: Do not let what you think about yourselves exceed what is right for you to think!

So no one should act as though he needed by God more than the others!"},{"number":6,"verse":"Instead, since each one of us can do various things that differ according to the abilities that God has given to us, we should do them diligently and cheerfully! Those whom God has enabled to speak messages from him should speak what corresponds to what they believe God told them."},{"number":7,"verse":"Those whom God has enabled to serve others should do that.
