This one was written, but it was not sealed. He did that in order that others would read the message that the servant was carrying in his hand."},{"number":6,"verse":"This is what was written in the message: “Some people in the nearby countries have heard a report that you and the other Jews are rebuilding the wall in order to be able to resist attacks, because you are planning to revolt against the king of Babylon. And the report also says that you are planning to become the king of the Israelis. Geshem says that what they have reported is true."},{"number":7,"verse":"People are also saying that you have appointed some prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem that you, Nehemiah, are now the king in Judea. King Artaxerxes will certainly hear these reports, and then you will be in big trouble. So I suggest that we should meet together to talk about this matter.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"When I read that message, I sent the messenger back to Sanballat to say, “None of what you are saying is true. You have ◄made this up/concocted this► in your own head/mind.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"I said that because I knew that they were trying to cause us to be afraid, with the result that we would stop working on the wall. So I actually became more determined (OR, I prayed to God to help me) to continue the work."},{"number":10,"verse":"One day I went to talk with Shemaiah, son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel. I went to talk with him in his house, because he was not able (OR, allowed) to leave his house. He said to me, “You and I must enter the very sacred place in the temple and lock the doors, because people are going to come to kill you at night.”"},{"number":11,"verse":"I replied, “I ◄am not that kind of person/do not do things like that► [RHQ]! I would not run and hide in the temple to save my life! No, I will not do that!”"},{"number":12,"verse":"When I thought about what he had said, I realized that God had not told Shemaiah to say that to me. I realized that Tobiah and Sanballat had bribed him to say that to me."},{"number":13,"verse":"They had bribed him to cause me to be afraid. They wanted me to disobey God's commands and sin by hiding in the temple. If I did that, they would be able to ruin my reputation [MTY] and discredit me."},{"number":14,"verse":"So I prayed, “My God, do not forget what Tobiah and Sanballat have done. Punish them. And do not forget that the female prophet Noadiah and some of the other prophets have also tried to cause me to be afraid.”"},{"number":15,"verse":"They finished building the wallOn October 2 we finished rebuilding the wall. We did it all in 52 days."},{"number":16,"verse":"When our enemies in the nearby countries heard about that, they realized that they had been humiliated, because everyone knew that it was because God helped us that we had been able to do this work and that they had not been able to force us to quit."},{"number":17,"verse":"During this time, the Jewish leaders had been sending many messages/letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah had been sending messages back to them."},{"number":18,"verse":"Many people in Judea were closely associated with Tobiah, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah.

So Tobiah sent many letters to me to try to cause me to become afraid."}]}
