He said to David, “Why have you come down here? Is someone taking care of those few sheep that you left in the desert? I know you are just a ◄smart-aleck/brat►! You just want to watch the battle!”"},{"number":29,"verse":"David replied, “Have I done something wrong? I was merely asking a question!”"},{"number":30,"verse":"Then he walked over to another man and asked him the same question, but the man gave him the same answer.

And I will do the same to this heathen Philistine, because he has defied/ridiculed the army of the all-powerful God!"},{"number":37,"verse":"Yahweh has rescued me from paws of lions and bears, and he will rescue me from this Philistine!” Then Saul said to David, “All right, go and fight him, and I hope/desire that Yahweh will help you!”"},{"number":38,"verse":"Then Saul gave to David his own clothes that he always wore in battles, and he gave him a bronze helmet and a coat made of metal plates."},{"number":39,"verse":"David put these things on. Then he fastened his sword over them, and tried to walk. But he could not walk, because he was not accustomed to wearing those things. So David said to Saul, “I cannot fight wearing all these things, because I am not accustomed to wearing them!” So he took them off."},{"number":40,"verse":"Then he took his walking/shepherd's stick, and he picked up five smooth stones from the brook/stream. He put them in the pouch of his shoulder-bag.

But I am coming to you ◄in the name/with the authority► of almighty Yahweh. He is the God whom the army of Israel worships, and he is the God whom you have defied/ridiculed."},{"number":46,"verse":"Today Yahweh will enable me to defeat you. I will strike you down and cut off your head. And we Israelis will kill many Philistine soldiers and give their bodies to the birds and wild animals to eat. And everyone in the world will hear about it and know that we Israeli people worship an all-powerful God."},{"number":47,"verse":"And everyone here will know that Yahweh can rescue people without a sword or a spear. Yahweh always wins his battles, and he will enable us to defeat all of you Philistines.”"},{"number":48,"verse":"As Goliath came closer to attack David, David ran quickly toward him."},{"number":49,"verse":"He put his hand into his shoulder-bag and took out one stone. He put in his sling and hurled it toward Goliath. The stone hit Goliath on the forehead and cracked his skull, and he fell face down onto the ground."},{"number":50,"verse":"Then David ran and stood over Goliath. He pulled Goliath's sword from its sheath and killed him with it, and then cut off his head. In that way David defeated the Philistine without having his own sword. He used only a sling and a stone! When the other Philistines saw that their great warrior was dead, they ran away."},{"number":52,"verse":"The Israeli men shouted and ran after them. They pursued them all the way to Gath and to the gates of Ekron city.
