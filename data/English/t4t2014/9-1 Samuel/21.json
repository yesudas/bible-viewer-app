Ahimelech trembled when he saw David because he was afraid that something bad had happened. He said to David, “Why are you alone? Why have no men come with you?”"},{"number":2,"verse":"David deceived Ahimelech by replying, “The king sent me. But he does not want anyone to know anything about what he sent me to do. I have told my men where they should meet me."},{"number":3,"verse":"Now I want to know, do you have any food here for me to eat [IDI]? Could you give me five loaves of bread, or whatever other food that you can find?”"},{"number":4,"verse":"The priest answered David, “There is no ordinary bread here, but I have some of the sacred bread that was placed before Yahweh. Your men may eat it if they have not slept with [EUP] women recently.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"David replied, “They have not been near women for many days. I do not allow my men to defile themselves by sleeping with women while they are preparing to fight in battles. They must continue to keep themselves acceptable to God when they are on ordinary trips, and today they have kept themselves acceptable to God because now we are doing something very special/important.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"The only bread that the priest had was the sacred bread that had been placed in Yahweh's presence in the Sacred tent.

Give it to me.”"},{"number":10,"verse":"So Ahimelech gave it to him, and David left there. He and his men and went to Gath city in the Philistia region, to stay with King Achish."},{"number":11,"verse":"But the officers of King Achish objected to David being there. They said to King Achish, “This man is [RHQ] David, the king of Israel! He is the one [RHQ] whom our enemies, the Israeli people, honored by dancing and singing, ‘Saul has killed thousands of his enemies, but David has killed tens of thousands of them!’ ”"},{"number":12,"verse":"David heard what those men were saying, so he was afraid of what King Achish might do to him."},{"number":13,"verse":"So he pretended that he was insane.
