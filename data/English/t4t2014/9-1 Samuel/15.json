His army prepared to attack them suddenly by hiding in the valley."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then Saul sent this message to the Ken people-group who lived in that area: “You acted kindly toward all our Israeli ancestors when they left Egypt. But we are going to kill all of the Amalek people-group, because they opposed/attacked our ancestors. So move away from where the Amalek people-group live. If you do not move away, you will be killed when they are killed.” So when the Ken people-group heard that, they immediately left that area."},{"number":7,"verse":"Then Saul's army slaughtered the Amalek people-group, from Havilah town in the east to Shur town in the west.

But someone told Samuel, “Saul went to Camel city, where he has set up a monument to honor himself.

I have obeyed what Yahweh told me to do.”"},{"number":14,"verse":"But Samuel replied, “If that is true, why is it that I hear cattle mooing and I hear sheep bleating?”"},{"number":15,"verse":"Saul replied, “The soldiers took them from the Amalek people-group. They saved the best sheep and cattle, in order to offer them as sacrifices to Yahweh, your God. But we have completely destroyed all the others.”"},{"number":16,"verse":"Samuel said to Saul, “Stop talking! Allow me to tell you what Yahweh said to me last night.” Saul replied, “Tell me what he said.”"},{"number":17,"verse":"Samuel said, “Previously you did not think that you were important.

It is better to obey Yahweh than to offer sacrifices to him. It is better to pay attention to what he says than to burn the fat of rams, even though God said they should be sacrificed to him."},{"number":23,"verse":"To rebel against God is as sinful as doing sorcery/black magic, and being stubborn is as sinful as worshiping idols. So, because you disobeyed what Yahweh told you to do, he has declared that you will no longer be king.”"},{"number":24,"verse":"Saul asks to be forgivenThen Saul said to Samuel, “Yes, I have sinned. I disobeyed what you told me to do, which is what Yahweh commanded. I did that because I was ◄afraid of/worried about► what my men would say if I did not do what they wanted. So I did what they demanded."},{"number":25,"verse":"But now, please forgive me for having sinned. And come back with me to where the people are in order that I may worship Yahweh.”"},{"number":26,"verse":"But Samuel replied, “No, I will not go back with you.

But please honor me in front of the leaders of the Israeli people and in front of all the other Israeli people by coming back to them with me in order that I may worship Yahweh your God.”"},{"number":31,"verse":"So Samuel finally agreed to do that, and they went together back to where the people were, and Saul worshiped Yahweh there."},{"number":32,"verse":"Samuel executed King AgagThen Samuel said, “Bring King Agag to me.” So they brought Agag to him.
