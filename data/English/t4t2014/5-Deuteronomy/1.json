You saw how he brought you safely here, like a man would carry his son. [SIM]’"},{"number":32,"verse":"I reminded them that he always went ahead of them while they traveled in the desert.

None of these evil people will ever see that good land which I solemnly promised to give to your ancestors.’"},{"number":37,"verse":"But because of what your ancestors did, Yahweh was also angry with me. He said to me, ‘You also will not enter that land."},{"number":38,"verse":"Joshua, the son of Nun, who is your helper, will enter it. Encourage him, because he is the one who will enable you Israeli people to occupy that land.’"},{"number":39,"verse":"Then Yahweh said to all of us, ‘You said that your children would be captured by your enemies.

If you go, your enemies will defeat you.” ’"},{"number":43,"verse":"So I told that to your ancestors, but they would not heed what I said. They again rebelled against what Yahweh commanded them to do. Their soldiers proudly/arrogantly marched up into that hilly region."},{"number":44,"verse":"Then the men of the Amor people-group who lived in that region came out of their towns and attacked those soldiers. They chased your ancestors' soldiers like a swarm of bees do, and they pursued their men south from the Edom area and defeated them at Hormah city."},{"number":45,"verse":"So your ancestors went back to Kadesh-Barnea and cried out to request Yahweh to help them, but he did not heed them. He did not pay any attention to them [DOU]."},{"number":46,"verse":"So we stayed there at Kadesh-Barnea for a long time.”"}]}
