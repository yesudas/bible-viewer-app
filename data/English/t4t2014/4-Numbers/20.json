There is no grain, there are no figs, no grapes, and no pomegranates here. And there is no water for us to drink!”"},{"number":6,"verse":"Aaron and Moses/I turned away from the people and went to the entrance of the Sacred Tent and prostrated themselves/ourselves on the ground.

Now we have set up our tents here at Kadesh, a town at the border of your land."},{"number":17,"verse":"Please allow us to travel through your country. We will be careful to not walk through your fields and your vineyards. We will not even drink water from your wells.

We will not allow you to travel through our land!” Then he sent the strongest soldiers in his army to prevent the Israelis from entering his country."},{"number":21,"verse":"So, because the king of Edom refused to allow the Israelis to travel through his country, the Israelis turned and traveled a different way."},{"number":22,"verse":"Aaron diedThe Israeli people left Kadesh.
