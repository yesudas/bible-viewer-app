He said, “A certain man had two sons."},{"number":12,"verse":"One day the younger son said to his father, ‘Father, I do not want to wait until you(sg) die. Give me now the share of your property that belongs to me!’ So the man divided his property between his two sons."},{"number":13,"verse":"A few days later, the younger son sold his share. He gathered his money and other things together and went to a country far away.

So his father came out and pleaded with him to come in."},{"number":29,"verse":"But he replied to his father, ‘Listen to me! For many years I have worked for you like a slave.
