Others were saying that one of the other former prophets had become alive again and was doing those miracles."},{"number":9,"verse":"But Herod said, “It cannot be John who is doing these things, because I commanded my soldiers to cut off his head.

He also healed the sick people."},{"number":12,"verse":"(Jesus fed over 5000 people miraculously.) Late in the afternoon the twelve apostles came to him and said, “This is a place where nobody lives, so dismiss the people so that they can go to the surrounding villages and other places where they can get some food and find places to stay.”"},{"number":13,"verse":"But he said to them, “No, you yourselves give them something to eat!” They replied, “We(exc) have only five small loaves and two cooked fish. Are you(sg) going to give us the money to go somewhere and buy food for all these people?”"},{"number":14,"verse":"There were about five thousand men there.

It is also necessary that I be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the men who teach the Jewish laws {that the Jewish elders and the chief priests and the men who teach the Jewish laws will reject me}. It is necessary that I be killed {that people will kill me}. Then on the third day after that, I will become alive again.”"},{"number":23,"verse":"Then he said to all of them, “If any one of you wants to be my disciple, you must not do only what you yourself desire to do. Specifically, you must be willing each day [MET] to let others hurt you and disgrace you. That is like what is done to criminals who are forced to carry [MET] crosses to the place where they will be executed. That is what anyone who wants to be my disciple must do."},{"number":24,"verse":"You must do that, because those who try to save their lives by denying that they belong to me when people want to kill them for believing in me will not live eternally, but those who are killed because of being my disciples will live forever with me."},{"number":25,"verse":"People might get everything that they want in this world, but ◄they are really gaining nothing if they do not get eternal life by becoming my disciples!/are they really gaining anything if they do not get eternal life by becoming my disciples?► [RHQ]"},{"number":26,"verse":"Those who reject my message and refuse to say that they belong to me, I, the one who came from heaven, will also refuse to say that they belong to me when I come back with the holy angels, and have the glorious brightness that my Father has."},{"number":27,"verse":"But listen carefully!

When they woke up, they saw Jesus' brightness. They also saw the two men standing with him."},{"number":33,"verse":"As Moses and Elijah were starting to leave Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is wonderful for us to be here! Allow us to make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah!” But he really did not realize what he was saying."},{"number":34,"verse":"As he was saying that, a bright cloud appeared and covered them. The disciples were afraid as the cloud surrounded them."},{"number":35,"verse":"God [MTY/EUP] spoke to them from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son. He is the one whom I have chosen to do a great work for me.

What you think is perverted! How long must I be with you before you are able to do what I do [RHQ]? How long must I endure your lack of faith?” Then he said to the boy's father, “Bring your(sg) son here to me!”"},{"number":42,"verse":"While they were bringing the boy to Jesus, the demon attacked the boy, threw him to the ground, and shook him severely. But Jesus rebuked the evil spirit and healed the boy. Then he returned him to his father's care."},{"number":43,"verse":"All the people there were amazed at the great power of God.

The disciples began to argue among themselves about which one of them would be the greatest when Jesus became king."},{"number":47,"verse":"But Jesus perceived what they were thinking. So he brought a young child to his side."},{"number":48,"verse":"He said to the disciples, “Those who, because they love me, (OR, because they want to behave like me) welcome a little child ◄like this one/as I would► [MTY], God considers that [MET] they are welcoming me. And those who welcome me, God considers that [MET] they are welcoming him, the one who sent me. Remember that those among you who think of themselves as being very unimportant will be the ones whom God considers to be great.”"},{"number":49,"verse":"(Jesus told them not to forbid others from expelling demons.) John replied to Jesus, “Master, we(exc) saw a man who was expelling demons, claiming that he had authority from you [MTY] to do that. So we told him to stop doing it, because he is not one of us disciples.”"},{"number":50,"verse":"But Jesus said to him and the other disciples, “Do not tell him not to do that! Remember that those who are not opposing you are trying to achieve the same goals that you are!”"},{"number":51,"verse":"(People in a Samaritan town refused to welcome Jesus.) When it was almost time for God to take him up to heaven, Jesus firmly resolved to go to Jerusalem."},{"number":52,"verse":"He sent some messengers to go ahead of him, and they entered a village in Samaria district to prepare for him [SYN] to go there."},{"number":53,"verse":"But the Samaritans did not like the Jews because of their insisting that it was necessary to go to Jerusalem to worship God. So, because Jesus had firmly resolved to go to Jerusalem, they would not let him come to their village."},{"number":54,"verse":"When two of his disciples, James and John, heard about that, they said, “Lord, do you(sg) want us(exc) to pray that God will send fire down from heaven, as the prophet Elijah did long ago, and destroy those people?”"},{"number":55,"verse":"But Jesus turned and rebuked them for saying that."},{"number":56,"verse":"So they went to a different village."},{"number":57,"verse":"(Jesus told three people what it would cost them if they became his disciples.)

After my father dies I will bury him, and then I will come with you.”"},{"number":60,"verse":"But Jesus said to him, “God considers that those who do not have eternal life are dead [MET]. Let those people do the work of burying people who die. As for you, go and tell people about how God wants ◄to rule/to have complete control over► people's lives!”"},{"number":61,"verse":"Someone else said, “Lord, I will come with you and be your disciple, but first let me go home to say goodbye to my relatives.”"},{"number":62,"verse":"Jesus said to him, “Anyone who is plowing his field should not look back to see what he has done. He must look forward to what is ahead. Similarly, anyone who continues to be concerned about his family and other things he has left behind is not fit to serve me and tell others about how God wants to rule [MTY] people's lives.”"}]}
