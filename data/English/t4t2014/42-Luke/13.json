Pilate, the Roman governor, had ordered soldiers to kill them [MTY] while they were offering sacrifices in the Temple there."},{"number":2,"verse":"Jesus replied to them, “Do you think that this happened to those people from Galilee because they were more sinful than all the other people from Galilee?"},{"number":3,"verse":"I assure you, that was not so! But instead of being concerned about them, you need to remember that God will similarly punish you eternally if you do not turn from your sinful behavior."},{"number":4,"verse":"Or, consider the eighteen people who died when the tower at Siloam outside Jerusalem fell on them. Do you think that this happened to them because they were more sinful than all the other people who lived in Jerusalem?"},{"number":5,"verse":"I assure you, that was not so! But instead, you need to realize that God will similarly punish you eternally if you do not turn from your sinful behavior!”"},{"number":6,"verse":"Jesus warned that he would punish the Jews for not showing that they appreciated God's blessings.Then Jesus told them this illustration to show how God would treat the Jews, whom he continually blessed, but who did not do things that please him: “A man planted a fig tree on his farmland. ◄Each year/Many times► he came to it looking for figs, but there were no figs."},{"number":7,"verse":"Then he said to the gardener, ‘Look here! I have been looking for fruit on this fig tree every year for the past three years, but there have been no figs.

Immediately she stood up straight, and she praised God!"},{"number":14,"verse":"But the man in charge ◄of the synagogue/of the meeting place► was angry because Jesus had healed her ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day►. He considered that healing was doing work. So he said to the people, “There are six days each week in which our Jewish laws permit people to work. If you need healing, those are the days to come ◄to the synagogue/to the meeting place► and be healed. Do not come on our Jewish day of rest!”"},{"number":15,"verse":"Then the Lord replied to him, “You(sg) and your fellow religious leaders are hypocrites! ◄On the Sabbath/On the our Jewish day of rest►, just like on every other day, ◄each of you unties his ox or donkey, and then leads it from the food trough to where it can drink water./does not each of you untie his ox or donkey, and then lead it from the food trough to where it can drink water?► [RHQ] That is work, too!"},{"number":16,"verse":"This woman is more important than an animal; she is a Jew, descended from Abraham!

That small amount of yeast made the whole batch of dough swell up.”"},{"number":22,"verse":"Jesus warns that not all people who think that they will go to heaven will go there.Jesus continued traveling, along with the disciples, through various towns and villages on the way to Jerusalem. As they went, he was teaching the people."},{"number":23,"verse":"Someone asked him, “Lord, will there be only a few people who are saved {whom God saves}?” He replied to them, “There will not be many, because the way to heaven [MET] is like a narrow door."},{"number":24,"verse":"Therefore, try hard to enter that narrow doorway, because I tell you that many people will try to enter heaven by some other way, but they will not be able to get in."},{"number":25,"verse":"God is like the owner of a house.

I am expelling demons and performing miracles today, and I will continue doing it for a short time. After that, I will finish my work."},{"number":33,"verse":"But I must continue my trip to Jerusalem during the coming days, because they killed many other prophets there, and since I am also a prophet, no other place is appropriate for people to kill me.’ ”"},{"number":34,"verse":"Then Jesus said, “O people of [MTY] Jerusalem [APO]!

But you did not want me to do that."},{"number":35,"verse":"So listen to this: Your city [MTY] (OR, your temple) is going to be abandoned (OR, God will no longer protect it). I will [MTY] also tell you this: I will enter your city only once more.
