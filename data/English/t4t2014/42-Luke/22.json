They offered to give him money for doing it."},{"number":6,"verse":"So he agreed, and they gave him the money. Then he tried to find an opportunity to enable them to seize Jesus when there was no crowd around him."},{"number":7,"verse":"Jesus arranged for his disciples to prepare the Passover meal.Then the day during the first part of the week-long festival of Unleavened Bread came, the day when the lambs for the Passover celebration had to be killed."},{"number":8,"verse":"So Jesus said to Peter and John, “Go and prepare the meal for the Passover celebration.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"They replied to him, “Where do you(sg) want us to prepare it?”"},{"number":10,"verse":"He said to the two of them, “Listen carefully. When you two enter the city, a man who is carrying a large jar of water will meet you. Follow him. When he enters a house,"},{"number":11,"verse":"tell the owner of the house, ‘Our teacher says that we(exc) should ask you(sg) to please show us the room that he arranged with you where he can eat the Passover meal with us, his disciples [RHQ].’"},{"number":12,"verse":"He will show you a large room that is on the upper floor of the house.

Yet they give themselves the title, ‘ones who help the people.’"},{"number":26,"verse":"But you should not be like them! Instead, those who want God to consider them the greatest should act as though they were the youngest, since the youngest are expected to serve the older ones.

Then they said to him, “Because you(sg) say [IRO] that you are a prophet, prove it by telling us who it was that struck you!”"},{"number":65,"verse":"They said many other evil things about him, insulting him."},{"number":66,"verse":"The Jewish leaders asked Jesus about his identity.At dawn the next morning, many of the Jewish leaders gathered together. The group included the chief priests and the men who taught the Jewish laws. They took Jesus to the Jewish Council.
