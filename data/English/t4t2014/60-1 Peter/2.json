God is joining you together into a holy group indwelt by his Spirit, to do deeds that are pleasing to him.Therefore, do not act maliciously in any way or deceive others. Do not ◄be a hypocrite/try to make others think that you have qualities that you do not really have►, and do not ◄envy/be jealous of► others. Do not ever slander anyone."},{"number":2,"verse":"Just like newborn babies long for their mothers' pure milk [MET], you should long for God's spiritual truth, so that by learning it you may become spiritually mature. You need to do this until the day when God will free you completely from all the evil in this world."},{"number":3,"verse":"Also, you need to do this because you have experienced that the Lord acts in a good way toward you."},{"number":4,"verse":"You have come to the Lord Jesus. He is like an important stone [MET] put in the foundation of a building, but he is living, not lifeless like a stone. He was rejected by many people {Many people rejected him}, but God chose him and considers him to be very precious."},{"number":5,"verse":"And like men build houses with stones [MET], God is causing you to be joined together into a group in which God's Spirit lives, in order that you, because of what Jesus Christ did for us, might, like priests who offer sacrifices, do deeds that are pleasing to God."},{"number":6,"verse":"What Isaiah wrote in the Scriptures shows us that this is true. He wrote these words that God said, Note this well: I am placing in Jerusalem [MTY] one who is like [MET] an extremely valuable [DOU] ◄stone/cornerstone, the most important stone in the structure of a building►, and those who believe in him will never be disappointed."},{"number":7,"verse":"Therefore, God will honor you who believe in Jesus.

You are a group that represents God like priests do, and you rule with God [MET] like kings. You are ◄a holy group of people/a group of people who are separate from evil►. You are people who belong to God. This is in order that you might proclaim the virtues of God. He has called you from your former ways, when you were ignorant of his truth, into the marvelous understanding that he gives us [MET]. That is, he has called you out of spiritual darkness into spiritual light."},{"number":10,"verse":"What the prophet Hosea wrote is true of you, Formerly, you were not a people who had a relationship with God, But now you are God's people. At one time God had not acted mercifully toward you, But now he has acted mercifully toward you."},{"number":11,"verse":"Avoid obeying your self-directed natures. Conduct your lives in a good way among unbelievers.You people whom I love, I urge you to consider that you are like foreigners [MET, DOU] whose real home is in heaven. As a result, avoid doing the things that your self-directed nature desires, because those desires ◄fight against/always oppose► your souls."},{"number":12,"verse":"Keep conducting your lives in a good way among those who do not know God.

Love all your fellow believers. Revere God, and honor the king."},{"number":18,"verse":"You slaves must submit yourselves to your masters, even if they mistreat you. Imitate Christ in the way in which he suffered unjustly.You slaves who are believers, submit yourselves to your masters and completely respect them. Submit yourselves not only to those who act in a good and kind [DOU] way towards you, but also submit yourselves to those who act in a harsh way towards you."},{"number":19,"verse":"You should do that because God is pleased with those who, knowing that he is aware of what is happening to them, endure the pain that they suffer because of being treated unjustly by their masters {their masters have treated them unjustly}."},{"number":20,"verse":"God will certainly not [RHQ] be pleased with you if you do something that is wrong and as a result you are beaten {someone beats you}!
