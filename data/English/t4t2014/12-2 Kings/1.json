The king asked them, “Why did you return very quickly?”"},{"number":6,"verse":"They replied, “A man came to meet us, and said to us, ‘Return to the king who sent you and tell him that Yahweh says, “◄Is it because there no God in Israel that you are sending messengers to Ekron to consult Beelzebub, their god?/You seem to think there is no God in Israel, with the result that you are sending messengers to Ekron to ask Beelzebub, their god, whether you will recover.► [RHQ] Go tell the king that he will not recover from being injured; instead, he will surely die.” ’ ”"},{"number":7,"verse":"The king said to them, “The man who came to meet you and told that to you, what was his appearance like?”"},{"number":8,"verse":"They replied, “He was wearing a cloak made from camel hair (OR, he was a man with a long beard) and had a wide leather belt around his waist.” The king exclaimed, “That was Elijah!”"},{"number":9,"verse":"Then the king sent an officer with fifty soldiers to seize Elijah.
