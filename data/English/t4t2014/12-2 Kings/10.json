You have chariots and horses and weapons, and you live in cities that have walls around them. So as soon as you receive this letter,"},{"number":3,"verse":"choose one of the king's descendants, the one who is the best qualified, and appoint him to be your king. Then prepare to fight to defend him.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"But when they got those letters and read them, they became very afraid. They said, “King Joram and King Ahaziah could not resist him; ◄how can we resist him?/we cannot possibly resist him!►” [RHQ]"},{"number":5,"verse":"So the officer who was in charge of the palace and the mayor of the city sent a message to Jehu saying, “We want to serve you, and we are ready to do whatever you tell us to do. We will not appoint anyone to become our king. You do whatever you think is the best.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"So Jehu sent a second letter to them, writing this: “If you ◄are on my side/want to help me►, and if you are ready to obey me, kill King Ahab's descendants and cut off their heads and bring their heads to me here in Jezreel at this time tomorrow.” The seventy descendants of King Ahab were being brought up and supervised by the leaders of Samaria city."},{"number":7,"verse":"When they received the letter from Jehu, they killed all seventy of Ahab's descendants and cut off their heads. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel."},{"number":8,"verse":"A messenger came to Jehu and told him, “They have brought the heads of Ahab's descendants.” So Jehu commanded that the heads should be put in two piles at the city gate and that the heads should stay there until the next morning."},{"number":9,"verse":"The next morning he went out to the city gate and said to all the people, “I am the one who plotted against King Joram and killed him.

He has caused to happen what he told the prophet Elijah would happen.”"},{"number":11,"verse":"Then Jehu executed all the other relatives of Ahab in Jezreel, and all Ahab's officers, and close friends, and his priests.

Along the road, he was met by Jonadab, a leader of the Rechab clan. Jehu greeted him and said to him, “Are you as devoted to me [IDI] as I am devoted to you?” Jonadab replied, “Yes, I am.” Jehu said, “If you are, shake hands with me.” So Jonadab shook hands with him, and Jehu helped him to get into his chariot."},{"number":16,"verse":"Jehu said to him, “Come with me, and you will see that I am very dedicated to Yahweh.” So they rode together to Samaria."},{"number":17,"verse":"When they arrived in Samaria, Jehu killed all of Ahab's relatives who were still alive.

I am going to make a great sacrifice to Baal. I want all of them to be there. Any of them who is not there will be executed.” But Jehu was planning to trick them; he was planning to kill all those who worshiped Baal."},{"number":20,"verse":"Then Jehu commanded, “Announce that we are going to set aside a day to honor Baal.” So they did that."},{"number":21,"verse":"Jehu decided what day they would gather and sent messages throughout Israel telling everyone on what day to gather, and on that day, everyone who worshiped Baal came.

Be sure that no one who worships Yahweh has come in.”"},{"number":24,"verse":"Then he and Jonadab prepared to offer sacrifices and other offerings to Baal that would be completely burned on the altar that was there in Samaria. But Jehu had stationed eighty of his men outside the temple, and had said to them, “I want you to kill all the people who are in the temple. Anyone who allows one of them to escape will be executed!”"},{"number":25,"verse":"As soon as Jehu and Jonadab had finished killing the animals that would be completely burned to be an offering to Baal, they went outside and said to the guards and officers, “Go in and kill all of them! Do not allow any of them to escape!” So the guards and officers went in and killed them all with their swords. Then they dragged their corpses outside the temple. Then they went into the inner room of the temple,"},{"number":26,"verse":"and they carried out the sacred pillar of Baal that was there, and they burned it."},{"number":27,"verse":"So they destroyed that pillar that honored Baal, and then they burned down the temple, and made it a latrine. And it is still a latrine!"},{"number":28,"verse":"That is how Jehu got rid of the worship of Baal in Israel."},{"number":29,"verse":"But Jehu did not quit committing the kinds of sins that Jeroboam had committed, sins that induced the people of Israel to sin by worshiping the gold statues of calves in Bethel and Dan cities."},{"number":30,"verse":"Then Yahweh said to Jehu, “You have done what pleased me by getting rid of all of Ahab's descendants. So I promise you that your son and grandson and great-grandson and great-great-grandson will all be kings of Israel.”"},{"number":31,"verse":"But Jehu did not obey all the laws of Yahweh, the God of the Israeli people. He did not stop committing the sins that Jeroboam had committed, sins that induced the Israeli people to sin."},{"number":32,"verse":"(Jehu died) At that time, Yahweh began to cause the territory controlled by Israel to become smaller. The army of King Hazael of Syria conquered much of the Israeli territory."},{"number":33,"verse":"He conquered the parts east of the Jordan River, as far south as Aroer town on the Arnon River.
