Even if Yahweh himself would open the windows of the sky and send grain down to us, that certainly could not [RHQ] happen!” Elisha replied, “Because you said that, you [SYN] will see it happen, but you will not be able to eat any of the food!”"},{"number":3,"verse":"The Syrian army became frightened and leftThat day there were four men who had ◄leprosy/a dreaded skin disease► who were sitting outside the gate of Samaria city. They said to each other, “◄Why should we wait here until we die?/It is ridiculous for us to wait here until we die.►) [RHQ]"},{"number":4,"verse":"If we go into the city, we will die there, because there is no food there. If we remain sitting here, we will die here. So let's go to where the army of Syria has set up their tents. If they kill us, we will die. But if they allow us to remain alive, we will not die.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"So when it was getting dark, those four men went to the camp where the army of Syria had set up their tents. But when they reached the camp, they saw that there was no one there."},{"number":6,"verse":"What had happened was that Yahweh had caused the army of Syria to hear something that sounded like a large army marching with chariots and horses. So they said to each other, “Listen! The king of Israel has hired the kings of Egypt and the Heth people-group and their armies, and they have come to attack us!”"},{"number":7,"verse":"So they all ran away that evening and left their tents and their horses and donkeys there, because they were afraid that they would be killed if they stayed there."},{"number":8,"verse":"When those four lepers came to the edge of the area where the soldiers of Syria had set up their tents, they went into one tent, and saw all the things that had been left there.

Then they entered another tent, and took things from there, and then went outside and hid them, also."},{"number":9,"verse":"But then they said to each other, “We are not doing what is right. We have good news to tell others today. If we do not tell it to anyone now, and if we wait until morning to tell it, we will certainly be punished by Yahweh.

Their horses and donkeys were still tied up, but their tents were all deserted/abandoned!”"},{"number":11,"verse":"The guards shouted the news, and some people who heard it went to the palace and reported it there."},{"number":12,"verse":"When the king heard it, he got up out of his bed and said to his officials, “I will tell you what the army of Syria is planning to do. They know that we have no food here, so they have left their tents and are hiding in the fields. They think that we will leave the city to find some food, and then they will capture us and capture the city.”"},{"number":13,"verse":"But one of his officials said, “Many of our Israeli people have already died from ◄hunger/not having anything to eat►).

They entered all the tents and took everything. So there was now plenty of everything! As a result people could buy ten pounds of fine wheat or twenty pounds of barley for only one piece of silver, which was what Yahweh had said would happen!"},{"number":17,"verse":"The king of Israel had appointed the officer who was his assistant to supervise what was happening at the marketplace.
