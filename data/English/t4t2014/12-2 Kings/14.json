He ruled in Samaria city for forty-one years."},{"number":24,"verse":"He did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He did not stop committing the same kind of sins that Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, committed, sins which induced the Israeli people to sin also."},{"number":25,"verse":"His soldiers conquered again some of the territory that had previously belonged to Israel, from Hamath city in the north to the Dead Sea in the south. That is what Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis worshiped, promised the prophet Jonah, the son of Amittai, from Gath-Hepher town, would happen."},{"number":26,"verse":"That happened because Yahweh saw that the Israelis' enemies were causing the Israelis to suffer very much.
