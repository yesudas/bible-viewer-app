He also broke into pieces the bronze replica/statue of a snake that Moses had made. He did that because the people had named it Nehushtan, and they were burning incense in front of it to honor it."},{"number":5,"verse":"Hezekiah trusted in Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis worshiped.

Please tell your soldiers to stop attacking us.
