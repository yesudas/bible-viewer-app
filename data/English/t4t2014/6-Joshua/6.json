They also brought out her father and mother and her brothers, and all the rest of her family. Joshua's men spared Rahab the prostitute. They also did not kill all her relatives, because she had hidden and protected the spies/men whom Joshua had sent to Jericho. The two men brought them all out and put them in a place outside the camp of the Israelis. Rahab still lives among us Israeli people.

But they burned everything else that was in the city."},{"number":26,"verse":"At that time, Joshua declared this very solemnly: “Yahweh will curse/punish anyone who tries to rebuild this city, Jericho.
