But there was a man from the tribe of Judah named Achan. He was the son of Carmi and grandson of Zabdi and great-grandson of Zerah. He disobeyed what Yahweh had commanded and took for himself some of those things. So Yahweh was very angry with the Israelis."},{"number":2,"verse":"Joshua told some of his men to go from Jericho to Ai town, which was east of Bethel city and near Beth-Aven town. He said to them, “Go to Ai and ◄spy out the area/see what the area is like►.” So the men went."},{"number":3,"verse":"When they returned to Joshua they said, “There are only a few people in Ai. So we do not need to send all of our soldiers to defeat them. Send two thousand or three thousand men to attack them. That will be enough.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"So about three thousand Israeli men went to attack Ai. But the men of Ai defeated them badly."},{"number":5,"verse":"They killed about thirty-six Israelis and chased the rest of Israeli men from the city gate to the bottom of the hill.

They also threw dirt on their heads to show that they were very sad about what had happened."},{"number":7,"verse":"Then Joshua prayed and said, “Lord God, you brought us Israelis safely across the Jordan River.

And Yahweh indicated that Achan was guilty."},{"number":19,"verse":"Then Joshua said to Achan, “Son, tell the truth [IDI]. Confess to Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship, what you have done.
