Say to them: Listen to what Yahweh says!"},{"number":3,"verse":"He says, ‘Terrible things will happen to those wicked prophets who proclaim their own ideas and have not seen any visions from me."},{"number":4,"verse":"You Israeli people, your prophets are as useless as [SIM] jackals/wolves that only dig through the ruins of a city ."},{"number":5,"verse":"Those prophets have not helped you Israeli people [MTY] to repair the places where the city walls have ◄been broken/crumbled►. That needs to be done in order that the walls will be strong at the time when I, Yahweh, allow your enemies to attack you."},{"number":6,"verse":"The visions and prophecies of those prophets are false. They say, “Yahweh told me this,” but I have not sent them to you to be my prophets.
