Instead, it was as though [MET] you were thrown into a field, because on the day that you were born, you were despised {everyone despised you}."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then it was as though [MET] I passed by and saw you lying in your own blood and kicking. And while you lay there kicking in your own blood, I said to you, “I want you to remain alive!”"},{"number":7,"verse":"It was as though I caused you to grow up, like plants in the field grow; you grew up and became tall and became like [MET] a very beautiful jewel.
