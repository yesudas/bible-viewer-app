When I was 30 years old, I was living among the Israeli people who had been ◄exiled from/forced to leave► Judah and had come to Babylon. I was living along the Kebar River/Canal south of Babylon. Almost five years after King Jehoiachin had been ◄exiled/forced to leave Judah►, on the fifth day of the fourth month of that year, it was as though the sky was opened and I saw visions from God. On that day,"},{"number":3,"verse":"God gave me messages in visions here in Babylonia, and I felt the power [MTY] of Yahweh on me."},{"number":4,"verse":"In one of the visions, I saw a windstorm coming from the north.
