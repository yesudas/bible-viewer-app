It was called the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon. It was 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. It was supported/held up by four rows of cedar pillars. There were 15 pillars in each row.

The walls were covered with cedar boards, from the floor to the rafters."},{"number":8,"verse":"In the courtyard behind the Hall of Judgment they built a house for Solomon to live in that was made like the other buildings. They also built the same kind of house for his wife, who was the daughter of the king of Egypt."},{"number":9,"verse":"All of those buildings and the walls around the palace courtyard were made from nice stones, from the foundations up to the eaves. The stones were cut at the quarry, according to the sizes that were needed, and the sides of the stones were shaped by cutting/smoothing them with saws."},{"number":10,"verse":"The foundations were also made from huge blocks of nice stones that were prepared at the quarry.

He knew how to make very nice things from bronze. His father had also lived in Tyre and had also been very skilled at making things from bronze, but Huram's father was no longer living. His mother was from the tribe of Naphtali. Huram was very wise and intelligent and was very skilled at making things from bronze. Solomon invited him to come to Jerusalem and supervise all the work of making things from bronze, and Huram agreed."},{"number":15,"verse":"He made two bronze pillars. Each one was 27 feet tall and 18 feet around it.

The pillar on the south side was named Jakin, and the pillar on the north side was named Boaz."},{"number":22,"verse":"The bronze tops/heads that were shaped like lilies were placed on top of the pillars.

His helpers put the bronze tank on the backs of the statues of the oxen."},{"number":26,"verse":"The sides of the tank were 3 in./8 cm. thick. The rim was like the rim of a cup. It curved outward, like the petals of a lily. When the tank was full, it held about 10, gallons of water."},{"number":27,"verse":"Huram also made ten bronze carts. Each was six feet long and six feet wide and 4-1/2 feet tall."},{"number":28,"verse":"On the sides of the carts there were panels which were set in frames."},{"number":29,"verse":"On those panels were bronze figures of lions, bulls, and winged creatures.

So no one ever knew what they weighed."},{"number":48,"verse":"Solomon's workers also made all the gold items for the temple: the altar; the table on which the priests put the sacred bread placed before God;"},{"number":49,"verse":"the ten lampstands that were put in front of the Very Holy Place, five on the south side and five on the north side; the decorations that resembled flowers; the lamps; the tongs to grasp the hot coals;"},{"number":50,"verse":"the cups, the gold lamp wick snuffers, the small lamp bowls, the dishes for incense, the pans for carrying the hot coals, and the hinges for the doors at the entrance to the Very Holy Place and for the doors at the entrance to the main room of the temple.
