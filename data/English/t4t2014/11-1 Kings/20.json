So allow us to go to the king of Israel, wearing course sacks around our waists and ropes on our heads/necks to indicate that we will be his slaves. Perhaps if we do that, he will allow you to remain alive.”"},{"number":32,"verse":"The king permitted them to do that, so they wrapped coarse sacks around their waists and put ropes on their heads/necks, and they went to the king of Israel and said to him, “Ben-Hadad, who greatly respects you, says, ‘Please do not kill me.’ ” Ahab replied, “Is he still alive? He is like a brother to me!”"},{"number":33,"verse":"Ben-Hadad's officials were trying to find out if Ahab would act mercifully, and when Ahab said “brother,” they ◄were optimistic/thought that Ahab would be merciful►.
