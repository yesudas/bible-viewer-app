He causes showers to fall on us, and he causes crops to grow well in the fields."},{"number":2,"verse":"What people think that the idols in their houses suggest is only nonsense, and people who say that they can interpret dreams tell only lies. When they tell people things to comfort them, what they say is useless, so the people who ◄consult/trust in► them are like lost sheep; they are attacked because they have no one to protect them like [MET] a shepherd protects his sheep."},{"number":3,"verse":"Yahweh says, “I am angry with the leaders [MET] of my people, and I will punish them. I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, take care of my people, the people of Judah, like a shepherd takes care of his [MET] flock, and I will cause them to be like [SIM] proud/powerful war horses."},{"number":4,"verse":"From Judah will come rulers who will be very important, like [MET] a cornerstone is the most important stone for a house, like [MET] a tent peg is very important for a tent, like [MET] a bow is very important for ◄an archer/a man who shoots arrows►."},{"number":5,"verse":"They will all be like [SIM] mighty warriors trampling their enemies in the mud during a battle. I, Yahweh, will be with them, so they will fight and defeat their enemies who ride on horses."},{"number":6,"verse":"I will cause the people [MTY] of Judah to become strong, and I will rescue the people [MTY] of Israel. I will bring them back from the countries to which they were ◄exiled/forced to go►; I will do that because I pity them. Then they will be as though I had not abandoned them, because I am Yahweh, their God, and I will answer them when they pray for help."},{"number":7,"verse":"The people of Israel will be like [SIM] strong soldiers; they will be as happy as people who have drunk a lot of wine.
