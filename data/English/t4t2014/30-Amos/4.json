That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it!"},{"number":4,"verse":"Go to Bethel and Gilgal towns where many people worship me and sin more and more [SAR]! I say that not because I want you to do it, but because it is what you have always been doing!

That is certainly true, because I, Yahweh, have said it!"},{"number":11,"verse":"I got rid of many of you, like I got rid of the people in Sodom and Gomorrah.
