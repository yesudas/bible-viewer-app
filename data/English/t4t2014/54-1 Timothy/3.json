He must welcome and care for guests. He must be able to teach God's truth well."},{"number":3,"verse":"He must not be a drunkard. He must not be ready/quick to fight those who make him angry. On the contrary, he must be gentle and he must not be quarrelsome. He must not be greedy for much money."},{"number":4,"verse":"He must lead and care for his own household/family well.
