The reports that you heard in Cyprus island about Tyre are true."},{"number":2,"verse":"You people who live along the coast near Tyre, and merchants of Sidon city, mourn silently. Your sailors went across the seas to many places like Tyre."},{"number":3,"verse":"They sailed across deep seas to buy grain in Egypt and other crops that are grown along the Nile River. Tyre became the city where people from all nations bought and sold goods."},{"number":4,"verse":"But now you people in Sidon should be ashamed, because you trusted in Tyre, which has been a strong fortress on an island in the sea. Tyre is like a woman who is saying, “Now it is as though I have not given birth to any children, or raised any sons or daughters.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"When the people of Egypt hear what has happened to Tyre, they will grieve very much."},{"number":6,"verse":"Sail to Tarshish and tell them what happened; weep, you people who live along the coast."},{"number":7,"verse":"The people in the very old city of Tyre were [RHQ] previously joyful. Traders [PRS] from Tyre established colonies in many distant nations."},{"number":8,"verse":"People from Tyre appointed kings over other places; their traders were wealthy; they were as powerful and wealthy as [MET] kings. So, who [RHQ] caused the people of Tyre to experience this disaster?"},{"number":9,"verse":"It was the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels who did it; he did it in order to cause you people in Tyre to not be proud anymore, to humiliate you men who are honored all over the world."},{"number":10,"verse":"You people of Tarshish, you must grow crops in your land instead of trading; spread out over your land like [SIM] the Nile River spreads over the land of Egypt when it floods, because there is no harbor in Tyre for your ships now."},{"number":11,"verse":"It is as though Yahweh stretched out his hand over the sea and shook the kingdoms of the earth.

The armies of Assyria have caused that land to become a place where wild animals from the desert live. They built dirt ramps to the top of the walls of the city of Babylon; then they entered the city and tore down the palaces and caused the city to become a heap of rubble."},{"number":14,"verse":"So wail, you sailors on the ships of Tarshish, because the harbor in Tyre where your ships stop is destroyed!"},{"number":15,"verse":"For seventy years, which is as long as kings usually live, people will forget about Tyre.

The merchants will not hoard their money; instead, they will give it to Yahweh's priests in order that they can buy food and nice clothes."}]}
