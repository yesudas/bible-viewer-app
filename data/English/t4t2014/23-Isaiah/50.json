I certainly did not [RHQ] get rid of you like a man who sells his children to get money to pay what he owes. No, the reason that I forced you to be exiled was to punish you because of the sins that you have committed [DOU]."},{"number":2,"verse":"When I came to you to rescue you, why did no one answer when I called out to you [RHQ]? Was there no one there [RHQ]? Or, did you think that I do not have the power [MTY] to rescue you [DOU]? Think about this: I can speak to a sea and cause it to become dry! I can cause rivers to become deserts with the result that the fish in the rivers die from thirst and rot."},{"number":3,"verse":"I cause the sky to become dark, as though [MET] it was wearing black clothes because it was mourning because someone had died.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"Yahweh our God has given me his wise message [MTY] in order that I may encourage those who are weary.
