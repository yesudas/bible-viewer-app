You allow people to steal things from widows and do unfair things to orphans."},{"number":3,"verse":"When I punish you, by sending people from distant lands to cause you to experience disasters, ◄to whom will you run to get help?/there will be no one who can help you.► [RHQ] Your valuable possessions will certainly not be safe [RHQ] anywhere."},{"number":4,"verse":"You will be able only to stumble along as you are taken away with other prisoners, or else your corpses will lie on the ground with others who have been killed. But even after that happens, Yahweh will still be very angry with you. He will still be ready to strike you again with his fist."},{"number":5,"verse":"(A warning to Assyria) Yahweh says, “Terrible things will happen to Assyria. It is true that their army is like a rod/club [DOU] with which I punish other nations because I am very angry with those nations [DOU]."},{"number":6,"verse":"Sometimes I send them to attack a godless nation, to fight against other people who have caused me to be angry.
