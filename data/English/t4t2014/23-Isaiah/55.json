It is as though [MET] you are thirsty, so come and get water from me! It is as though you have no money, but you can come and get things from me that are like wine and milk! You can get what you need from me, and you will not need to give me any money for them!"},{"number":2,"verse":"What you really need is to have a close relationship with me, so ◄why do you spend money to buy things that do not supply what you really need?/you should not spend money to buy things that do not supply what you really need.► [RHQ] ◄Why do you work hard to get money to buy things that do not ‘satisfy your inner beings/cause you to be happy’?/You should not work hard to get money to buy things that do not ‘satisfy your inner beings/cause you to be happy’.► [RHQ] Pay attention to what I say and acquire what is really good [MET]! If you do that, then in your soul you will truly be happy [MET]."},{"number":3,"verse":"Listen to me and come to me; pay attention to me, and if you do that, you will have new life in your soul. I will make an agreement with you that will last forever to faithfully love you like I loved King David."},{"number":4,"verse":"By what he did, I showed my power to many people-groups; I caused him to be a leader and commander [DOU] over the people of many nations."},{"number":5,"verse":"And similarly, you will summon people of other nations to come to you, nations that previously you have not heard about, and they had not heard about you; and they will come to you quickly because they will have heard that I, Yahweh, your God, the Holy One of Israel, have honored you."},{"number":6,"verse":"Seek to know me while it is still possible for you to do that; call to me while I am near!"},{"number":7,"verse":"Wicked people should abandon their wicked behavior, and evil people should stop thinking what is evil.

When the ground becomes moist, it causes plants to sprout and grow, with the result that the soil produces seed for the farmer to plant and grain to produce flour to make bread for people to eat."},{"number":11,"verse":"And similarly the things that I promise to do, I will always cause to happen; my promises will always be fulfilled [LIT]. They will accomplish the things that I gave them to accomplish [DOU]."},{"number":12,"verse":"You will leave Babylon joyfully, you will have peace as I lead you out.
