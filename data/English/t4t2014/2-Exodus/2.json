When she saw that he/I was a good-looking baby, she hid him/me for three months, because she was not willing to do what the king commanded."},{"number":3,"verse":"When she was unable to ◄hide him/me/keep it a secret► any longer, she got a basket made from tall reeds. She covered the basket with tar ◄to make it waterproof/so water could not get in►. Then she put him/me in the basket and put the basket in the water in the midst of the tall grass at the edge of the Nile River."},{"number":4,"verse":"His/My older sister was standing not far away, watching to see what would happen to him/me."},{"number":5,"verse":"Soon the king's daughter went down to the river to bathe. Her female servants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket amid the tall grass in the river. So she sent one of her servants to get it."},{"number":6,"verse":"When the servant brought the basket to her, she opened it, and was surprised to see ◄a baby that was/me►, crying.

Are you going to kill me just like you killed that Egyptian man yesterday?” Then Moses/I was afraid, because he/I thought, “Since that man knows what I did, surely other people know, too.”"},{"number":15,"verse":"And that was correct.

And Moses/I decided to live there. Later Jethro gave him/me his daughter Zipporah to be his/my wife."},{"number":22,"verse":"Later she gave birth to a son, and Moses/I named him Gershom, which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean 'foreigner', because he/I said, “I am living as a foreigner in this land.”"},{"number":23,"verse":"Many years later the king of Egypt died. The Israeli people in Egypt were still groaning because of the hard work they had to do as slaves.
