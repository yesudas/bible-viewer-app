Later Abraham's son, Isaac, was born, and when Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him. Later Isaac's son, Jacob, was born, and Isaac similarly circumcised him.

As for that fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt we(exc) do not know what has happened to him!’"},{"number":41,"verse":"So, they made an image out of gold that looked like a calf. Then they sacrificed animals and offered other things to honor that idol, and they sang and danced to honor the idol that they themselves had made."},{"number":42,"verse":"So God rejected them. He abandoned them to worship the sun, moon and stars in the sky. This agrees with the words that one of the prophets wrote that God said, You Israelite people [MTY], when you repeatedly killed animals and offered them as sacrifices during those forty years that you were in the desert, ◄you most certainly were not offering them to me!/what makes you think that you were offering them to me?► [RHQ]"},{"number":43,"verse":"On the contrary, you carried with you from place to place the tent that contained the idol representing the god Molech that you worshipped. You also carried with you the image of the star called Rephan. Those were idols that you had made, and you worshipped them instead of me.

They had made the tent exactly like God had commanded Moses to make it. It was exactly like the model that Moses had seen when he was up on the mountain."},{"number":45,"verse":"Later on, other ancestors of ours carried that tent with them when Joshua led them into this land. That was during the time that they took this land for themselves, when God forced the people who previously lived here to leave. So the Israelites were able to possess this land. The tent remained in this land and was still here when King David ruled."},{"number":46,"verse":"David pleased God, and he asked God to let him build a house where he and all of our Israelite people could worship God."},{"number":47,"verse":"But instead, God let David's son Solomon build a house where people could worship God.”"},{"number":48,"verse":"People can worship God anywhere, not only at certain places.“However, we(inc) know that God is greater than everything, and he does not live in houses that people [SYN] have made. It is like the prophet Isaiah wrote. He wrote these words that God had spoken:"},{"number":49,"verse":"Heaven is ◄my throne/the place from which I rule the entire universe►, and the earth is ◄my footstool/merely like a stool on which I may rest my feet►. I myself [SYN] have made everything both in heaven and on the earth. So you human beings, ◄you really cannot build a house that would be adequate for me!/do you think you can build a house that would be appropriate for me?► [RHQ] You cannot [RHQ] make a place good enough for me to live in!”"},{"number":51,"verse":"Stephen said that those who were listening to him were opposing God.“You people are extremely stubborn [MET], not wanting to obey God or listen [MTY] to him! You are exactly like your ancestors! You always resist the Holy Spirit as they did!"},{"number":52,"verse":"Your ancestors caused [RHQ] every prophet to suffer, including Moses. They even killed those who long ago announced that the Messiah would come, the one who always did what pleased God. And the Messiah has come! He is the one whom you recently turned over to his enemies and insisted that they kill him!"},{"number":53,"verse":"You are the people who have received God's laws. Those were laws that God caused angels to give to our ancestors. However, incredibly, you have not obeyed them!”"},{"number":54,"verse":"All the people there became very angry with Stephen.When the Jewish Council members and others there heard all that Stephen said, they became very angry. They were grinding their teeth together because they were so angry at him!"},{"number":55,"verse":"After Stephen said that he could see Jesus standing beside God in heaven, they stoned him.But the Holy Spirit completely controlled Stephen. He looked up into heaven and saw a dazzling light from God, and he saw Jesus standing at God's right side."},{"number":56,"verse":"“Look,” he said, “I see heaven open, and I see the one who came from heaven standing at God's right side!”"},{"number":57,"verse":"When the Jewish Council members and others heard that, they shouted loudly. They put their hands over their ears so that they could not hear him, and immediately they all rushed at him."},{"number":58,"verse":"They dragged him outside the city of Jerusalem and started to throw stones at him. The people who were accusing him took off their outer garments in order to throw stones more easily, and they put their clothes on the ground next to a young man whose name was Saul, so that he could guard them."},{"number":59,"verse":"While they continued to throw stones at Stephen, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!”"},{"number":60,"verse":"He asked the Lord to forgive them and he died. The disciples fled, some men buried Stephen, and Saul harassed believers. But the believers preached about Jesus wherever they were scattered.Then Stephen fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not punish them (OR, forgive them) [LIT] for this sin!” After he had said that, he died."}]}
