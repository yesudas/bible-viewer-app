Then he brought the rest of the money and presented it to the apostles [MTY]."},{"number":3,"verse":"People were terrified when they saw or heard that Ananias had died.Then Peter said, “Ananias, you(sg) let Satan completely control you [MTY] so that you(sg) tried to deceive the Holy Spirit and us(exc). ◄That was terrible!/Why did you do such a terrible thing?► [RHQ] You have kept for yourself some of the money you(sg) received for selling the land, pretending that you(sg) were giving us all of it."},{"number":4,"verse":"Before you(sg) sold that land, you truly owned [RHQ] it. And after you sold it, you could [RHQ] certainly still have used the money any way you wanted to. So why did you(sg) ever think [RHQ] about doing this wicked thing?

All the believers were meeting together regularly in the temple courtyard at the place called Solomon's Porch."},{"number":13,"verse":"All of the other people who had not yet believed in Jesus were afraid to associate with the believers, because they knew that if they did anything evil, God would punish them, as well as revealing it to the believers.

He persuaded some people to accompany him. But soldiers killed him, too, and all those who had accompanied him went off in different directions."},{"number":38,"verse":"So now I say this to you: Do not harm these men! Release them! I say this because if this is just something that humans have planned, they will not be able to do it. They will fail, like Theudas and Judas did!"},{"number":39,"verse":"But, if God has commanded them to do it, you will not be able to prevent them from doing it, because you will find out that you are opposing God!” The other members of the Council accepted what Gamaliel said."},{"number":40,"verse":"They told the temple guards to bring the apostles and beat/flog them.
