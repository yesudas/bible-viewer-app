These men came to Peter and John while the two of them were speaking to the people."},{"number":2,"verse":"These men were very angry, because the two apostles were teaching the people about Jesus. What they were telling them was that because ◄God caused Jesus to become alive again/God raised Jesus from the dead►, God would cause other people who had died to become alive again."},{"number":3,"verse":"So those officials seized Peter and John. Then they put them in jail. They had to wait until the next day to question Peter and John, because it was already evening and it was contrary to their Jewish law to question people at night."},{"number":4,"verse":"However, many people who had heard the message from Peter believed in Jesus. (OR, But many people had already believed in Jesus, because they had heard the message from Peter.) So the number of men who believed in Jesus increased to about five thousand."},{"number":5,"verse":"(Jewish leaders questioned Peter and John about healing the lame man.)

And who authorized [MTY] you to do this [DOU]?”"},{"number":8,"verse":"(Peter told them that Jesus healed the man and only Jesus could save people.)

After they did so, they commanded them both that they should never speak about Jesus, and they should not teach anyone about him [MTY] again."},{"number":19,"verse":"(Peter and John said that they needed to continue speaking about Jesus.)

But all the people there were praising God about what had happened to the lame man. They leaders knew that only God could have enabled Peter and John to miraculously heal the man, because the man was more than forty years old and he was lame when his mother bore him. They also knew that the people would become angry if they punished the two apostles. So, because they could not decide how to punish Peter and John, they finally let them go."},{"number":23,"verse":"(The believers talked to God about those who opposed him and them.)
