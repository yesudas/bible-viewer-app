But you are rejecting God's message. By doing that, you have shown that you are not worthy ◄to have eternal life/to live eternally with God►. Therefore, we are leaving you, and now we will go to the non-Jewish people to tell them the message from God."},{"number":47,"verse":"We are doing that also because the Lord God has commanded us to do it. He said to us, ‘I have appointed you to reveal things about me to non-Jewish people [MET] that will be like a light to them. I have appointed you to tell people everywhere [MTY] in the world about the one who came to save them.’ ”"},{"number":48,"verse":"While the non-Jewish people were listening to those words, they began to rejoice, and they repeatedly said that the message about the Lord Jesus was wonderful. And all of the non-Jewish people whom God had chosen ◄to have eternal life/to live eternally with God► believed the message about the Lord Jesus."},{"number":49,"verse":"At that time, many of the believers traveled around throughout that region. As they did that, they were proclaiming the message about the Lord Jesus [MTY]."},{"number":50,"verse":"People expelled the apostles, but the believers continued on.However, some leaders of [SYN] the Jews incited the most important men in the city and some important/influential women who had accepted what the Jews believe to oppose Paul and Barnabas. So those non-Jewish people incited other people also to persecute Paul and Barnabas. As a result they expelled the two men from their region."},{"number":51,"verse":"So, as the two apostles were leaving, they shook the dust from their feet to show those Jewish leaders that God had rejected them and would punish them. They left Antioch city and went to Iconium city."},{"number":52,"verse":"Meanwhile the believers in Antioch continued to rejoice greatly, and they continued to be completely controlled by the Holy Spirit."}]}
