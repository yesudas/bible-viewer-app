They started teaching the non-Jewish believers there, and said, “You ◄must be circumcised/must have God's mark put on you► to indicate you belong to God, as Moses commanded in the laws that he received from God. If you do not do that, you will not be saved {God will not save you}.”"},{"number":2,"verse":"Paul and Barnabas strongly disagreed with those Jews and started arguing with them.
