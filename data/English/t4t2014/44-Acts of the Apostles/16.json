He did that so that the Jews who lived in those places would accept Timothy, because they knew that his non-Jewish father had not allowed him to be circumcised {anyone to circumcise his son}."},{"number":4,"verse":"(Paul, Silas and Timothy told believers in Galatia what the church leaders had decided.) So Timothy went with Paul and Silas and they traveled to many other towns. In each town they told the believers the rules that had been decided by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem {that the apostles and elders in Jerusalem had decided} that non-Jewish believers should obey."},{"number":5,"verse":"God was helping the believers in those towns to trust more strongly in the Lord Jesus, and every day more people became believers."},{"number":6,"verse":"(Because of a vision in Troas, Paul went to preach in Macedonia.)

On the first ◄Sabbath/Jewish day of rest► after we(exc) arrived, we went outside the city gate down to the river. We had heard someone say that Jewish people gathered to pray there.

So we sat down and began to tell them the message about Jesus."},{"number":14,"verse":"A woman whose name was Lydia was one of those who were listening to Paul. She was a non-Jewish woman, from Thyatira city, who bought and sold expensive purple cloth. She had accepted what the Jews believe about God.

Another day, while we(exc) were going to the place where people regularly gathered to pray, we met a young woman who was a slave.

We(exc) prisoners are all here!”"},{"number":29,"verse":"The jailer shouted to someone to bring torches/lanterns, and after they brought them, he rushed into the jail and knelt down in front of Paul and Silas.

So you two can leave the jail now. Now you can go peacefully!”"},{"number":37,"verse":"But Paul said to the police officers, “The authorities commanded men to beat us in front of a crowd before those authorities had learned if we(exc) had done anything wrong! Then they ordered men to shove us into jail! But that was not legal, because we(exc) are Roman citizens! And now they want [RHQ] to send us away secretly! We will not accept that! Those Roman officials must come themselves and tell us that they are sorry, and take us out of jail.”"},{"number":38,"verse":"So the police officers went and told the city authorities what Paul had said. When those authorities heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were afraid that someone would report to more important officials what they had done, and as a result they would be punished {those officials would punish them}."},{"number":39,"verse":"So the city authorities came to Paul and Silas and told them that they were sorry for what they had done to them. The authorities brought them out of the jail, and repeatedly asked them to leave the city soon."},{"number":40,"verse":"After Paul and Silas left the jail, they went to Lydia's house. There they met with her and the other believers. They encouraged the believers to continue trusting in the Lord Jesus, and then the two apostles left Philippi."}]}
