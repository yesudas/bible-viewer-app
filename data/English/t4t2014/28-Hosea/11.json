They offered sacrifices to their statues of Baal, and they burned incense to honor them."},{"number":3,"verse":"The people of Israeli were like a little boy [MET], and it was as though it was I who taught them to walk, holding them by their hands. But they did not realize that it was I who was taking care of them."},{"number":4,"verse":"It was as though I fastened ropes around them to lead them, while I loved them and acted kindly toward them. It was as though they were young oxen [MET] and I lifted the yoke from their necks and bent down to feed them."},{"number":5,"verse":"But the people of Israel will become slaves again, like they were in Egypt, and the people of Assyria will [RHQ] rule over them, because the people of Israel refused to repent."},{"number":6,"verse":"Their enemies will use their swords to attack the cities of Israel and will destroy the bars in the gates of the city walls. As a result, the people of Israeli will not be able to accomplish the things that they planned to do."},{"number":7,"verse":"My people are determined to ◄turn away from/abandon► me. They say that I am the great all-powerful God, but they do not honor me at all."},{"number":8,"verse":"You people of Israel, I certainly do not want to [RHQ] abandon you and allow your enemies to capture you. I do not [RHQ] want to act toward you like I acted toward Admah and Zeboiim, cities that I completely destroyed when I destroyed Sodom. I [SYN] have changed my mind about punishing you; my desire to pity you has been aroused."},{"number":9,"verse":"Although I am extremely angry, I do not want to punish you severely; I do not want to ◄devastate/completely ruin► Israel. Humans would easily decide to do that, but I am God, not a human. I am the Holy One among you; although I am very angry with you, I will not destroy you."},{"number":10,"verse":"You will follow me when I roar like [SIM] a lion; when I roar, some of you my children will tremble as you return to Israel from the islands and seacoasts toward the west."},{"number":11,"verse":"Some of you will come swiftly from Egypt like a flock of birds; others will return from Assyria, like doves. I will enable you to live in your homes in Israel again. That will surely happen, because I, Yahweh, have said it.”"},{"number":12,"verse":"(Israel and Judah are condemned now) Yahweh says, “The people of Israel have ◄surrounded me with lies/constantly told lies to me►. And the people of Judah have also turned/rebelled against me, their God, the Holy One who always does what I promise to do.”"}]}
