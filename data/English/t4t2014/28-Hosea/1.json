That will illustrate how the people of Israel have turned away from me and worship ◄idols/other gods►.”"},{"number":3,"verse":"So I married Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim. She became pregnant and gave birth to my son."},{"number":4,"verse":"Yahweh said to me, “Give him the name Jezreel, which means 'God scatters “, because I will soon punish the descendants [MTY] of King Jehu by scattering them, because he killed many of my people at Jezreel town.

They will appoint one leader for all of them, and they will return from the countries to which they have been ◄exiled/forced to go►.
