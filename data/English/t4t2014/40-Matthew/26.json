There he said to most of us, “Stay here while I go over there and pray.”"},{"number":37,"verse":"He took Peter, James, and John with him. He became extremely distressed."},{"number":38,"verse":"Then he said to them, “I [SYN] am very sorrowful, so much so that I feel as if I were about to die! Remain here and stay awake with me!”"},{"number":39,"verse":"After going a little further, he threw himself face down on the ground. He prayed, “My Father, if it is possible [MTY], do not make me have to endure the suffering that is coming now. But do not do as I want. Instead, do as you want!”"},{"number":40,"verse":"Then he returned to the three disciples and saw that they were sleeping.

He prayed the third time, saying the same thing that he had prayed before."},{"number":45,"verse":"Then he returned to us disciples. He woke us up and said to us, “◄I am disappointed that you are still sleeping and resting!/Why are you still sleeping and resting?► [RHQ] Look! Someone is about to enable sinful men to seize me, the one who came from heaven!"},{"number":46,"verse":"Get up! Let's go to meet them! Here comes the one who is enabling them to seize me!”"},{"number":47,"verse":"After Judas enabled men to seize Jesus, Jesus ridiculed them, but the disciples fled.While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived.

They had been sent by the chief priests and elders {the chief priests and Jewish elders had sent them}."},{"number":48,"verse":"Judas had previously arranged to give them a signal, saying, “The man whom I will kiss is the one you want. Seize him!”"},{"number":49,"verse":"He immediately went to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Teacher!” Then he kissed Jesus on the neck/cheek."},{"number":50,"verse":"Jesus replied, “Friend, is it to kiss me that you are here?” (OR, Do what you have come for!”) Then the men who came with Judas stepped forward and seized Jesus."},{"number":51,"verse":"Suddenly, one of the men who was with Jesus pulled his sword out of its sheath. He struck the servant of the high priest to kill him, but only cut off his ear."},{"number":52,"verse":"Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back in its sheath! All those who try to kill others with a sword will themselves be killed with a sword!"},{"number":53,"verse":"Do you think that [RHQ] if I asked my Father, he would not immediately send more than ◄twelve armies of/72 thousand► angels to help me?"},{"number":54,"verse":"But if I did that, what the prophets have written in the Scriptures about what will happen to the Messiah would not be fulfilled {happen} [RHQ].”"},{"number":55,"verse":"At that time Jesus said to the crowd that was seizing him, “◄It is ridiculous that you have come here to seize me with swords and clubs, as if I were a bandit!/Have you come here to seize me with swords and clubs, as if I were a bandit?► [RHQ] Day after day I sat in the Temple courtyard, teaching the people. Why did you not arrest me then?"},{"number":56,"verse":"But all this is happening to fulfill what the prophets have written in the Scriptures about me.” Then all of us disciples deserted Jesus and ran away."},{"number":57,"verse":"Jesus was put on trial before the Jewish Council.The men who had seized Jesus took him to the house where Caiaphas, the high priest, lived. The men who taught the Jewish laws and the Jewish elders had already gathered there."},{"number":58,"verse":"Peter followed Jesus at a distance. He came to the high priest's courtyard. He entered the courtyard and sat down with the guards to see what would happen."},{"number":59,"verse":"The chief priests and the rest of the Jewish Council were trying to find people who would tell lies about Jesus so that they could convince the Roman authorities to execute him."},{"number":60,"verse":"But even though many people spoke lies about him, they did not find anyone who said anything that was useful. Finally two men came forward"},{"number":61,"verse":"and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy God's Temple and to rebuild it within three days.’ ”"},{"number":62,"verse":"Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to reply? What do you say about these things that they are saying to accuse you?”"},{"number":63,"verse":"But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I command you to tell us the truth, knowing that the all-powerful God is listening to you: Are you the Messiah, ◄the Son of God/the man who is also God►?”"},{"number":64,"verse":"Jesus replied, “Yes, it is as you say. But I will also say this to all of you: Some day you will see me, the one who came from heaven, sitting beside [MTY] Almighty God, and ruling. You will also see me coming on the clouds from heaven!”"},{"number":65,"verse":"Then the high priest tore his outer garment. That was the custom to show that he was shocked to hear Jesus say that he was equal to God. Then he said, “This man has insulted God! He claims to be equal with God! ◄We certainly do not need anyone else to testify against this man!/Why should we seek any more people who will testify against this man?► [RHQ] You heard what he said!"},{"number":66,"verse":"What have you decided?” The Jewish leaders replied, “According to our laws, he is guilty and deserves to be executed!”"},{"number":67,"verse":"Then some of them spat in his face. Others struck him with their fists. Others, after they blindfolded him, slapped him"},{"number":68,"verse":"and said, “Since you claim that [IRO] you are the Messiah, tell us who hit you!”"},{"number":69,"verse":"Peter denied three times that he knew Jesus.Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came up to him and looked at him. She said, “You also were with Jesus, that man from Galilee district!”"},{"number":70,"verse":"But while everyone there was listening, he denied it. He said, “I do not know what you are talking about!”"},{"number":71,"verse":"Then he went out to the gateway of the courtyard. Another servant girl saw him and said to the people who were standing nearby, “This man was with Jesus, the man from Nazareth.”"},{"number":72,"verse":"But Peter again denied it. He said, “May God punish me if I am lying! I tell you, I do not even know that man!”"},{"number":73,"verse":"After a little while, one of the people who were standing there approached Peter and said to him, “It is certain that you are one of those who were with that man. We can tell from your accent that you are from Galilee.”"},{"number":74,"verse":"Then Peter began to proclaim loudly that God should curse him if he was lying. He asked God in heaven to witness that he was telling the truth and said, “I do not know that man!” Immediately a rooster crowed."},{"number":75,"verse":"Then Peter remembered the words that Jesus had spoken to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will say three times that you do not know me.” And Peter went out of the courtyard, crying because he was very sad about what he had done."}]}
