Do not take an extra shirt, nor sandals in addition to what you are wearing, nor a walking stick.

But in any town where the people [MTY] refused to hear your message, God will punish them very severely.”"},{"number":16,"verse":"(Jesus instructed his disciples to be wary of their religious leaders and to endure when they are persecuted by people who refuse to accept the new message.) “Take note: After I send you out, you will be as defenseless as sheep [MET] in the midst of people who are as dangerous as wolves.

Similarly, because I am your teacher and master, you can expect that people will mistreat you, because they have mistreated me. The most you can expect is that people will treat you like they treat me. I am like the ruler of a household [MET]. But people have insulted me by calling me Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.
