He said to Jesus, “Lord/Sir, please heal me, because I know you are able to heal me if you are willing to.”"},{"number":3,"verse":"Then Jesus, disregarding the religious law that forbade people to come close to lepers, stretched out his hand and touched the man. He said to him, “I am willing to heal you, and I heal you now!” Immediately the man was healed from his leprosy {he was no longer a leper}."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then Jesus said to him, “Go and show yourself to a nearby priest so that he can examine you and verify that you no longer have leprosy. Then, after he tells the local people, they will knowthat you no longer have leprosy, and you will be able to associate with them again. Make sure that now you do not report about my healing you to anyone other than the priest. Then go to the Temple in Jerusalem and give the priest the offering that Moses commanded that people who have been healed from leprosy should offer as a sacrifice to God.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"Jesus healed from a distance a Roman officer's servant because the officer trusted in him.When Jesus went to Capernaum city, a Roman officer who commanded one hundred soldiers came to him.

I am a non-Jew, so I am not worthy for you, a Jew, to come into my house [MTY] and associate with me. Instead, just say that my servantis healed, and he will be healed."},{"number":9,"verse":"I believe this because, as for me, I am a man under the authority of others, and I also have soldiers under my authority. When I say to one of them ‘Go!’ he goes. When I say to another ‘Come!’ he comes. When I say to my slave, ‘Do this!’ he does it. And I believe that you speak with a similar kind of authority.”"},{"number":10,"verse":"When Jesus heard this, he marveled. He said to the crowd that was walking with him, “Listen to this: I have never before found anyone who has as firm a faith in me as this non-Jewish man has. Not even in Israel, where I would expect people to believe in me, have I found anyone who has the kind of faith in me that he has!"},{"number":11,"verse":"I tell you truly that many other non-Jewish people who will believe in me like this Roman officer will come from distant countries, including those far to the east and far to the west [SYN], and they will sit down to eat with [MTY] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in heaven, where God rules."},{"number":12,"verse":"Butthe Jews [IDM] who should have allowed God to rule over them will be sent to hell, where there is total darkness.

When they saw him and the two men who had been controlled by the demons, they begged Jesus to leave their region because they thought that he would destroy more things than just the pigs (OR, because they realized he must be very powerful)."}]}
