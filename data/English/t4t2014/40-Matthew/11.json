So he sent some of his disciples to him in order"},{"number":3,"verse":"to ask him, “Are you the Messiah who the prophets prophesied would come, or is it someone else that we should expect to come?”"},{"number":4,"verse":"After they asked Jesus that question, he answered them, “Go back and report to John what you hear me telling people and what you see me doing."},{"number":5,"verse":"I am enabling blind people to see and lame people to walk. I am healingpeople who have leprosy. I am enabling deaf people to hear and dead people to become alive again. I am telling poor people God's good message."},{"number":6,"verse":"Also tell John that God is pleased with people who do not stop believing in me because what I do is not what they expected the Messiah to do.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"When John's disciples had gone away, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said to them, “Think about what sort of person you went to see in the desolate area when you went there to see John. ◄You did not go there to listen to a man who constantly changed his message, like a reed that is blown {blows} back and forth in the wind [MET]!/Did you go thereto listen to a man whose message changes continually like long grass that is blown {blows} back and forth in the wind changes its direction?► [MET, RHQ]"},{"number":8,"verse":"Then what kind of person did you go there to see [RHQ]? ◄You did not go there to see a man who was wearing expensive clothes./Did you go there to see a man who was wearing expensive clothes?► [RHQ] No!

When John came and preached to you, he did not eat good food and did not drink wine, like most people do. But you rejected him saying, ‘A demon is controlling him!’"},{"number":19,"verse":"In contrast, I, the one who came from heaven, eat the same food and drink wine as other people do. But you reject me, saying, ‘Look! This man eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax collectors and other sinners!’ But people who really think about what John and I have done will realize that what we do is truly wise [MET, PRS].”"},{"number":20,"verse":"Jesus explained why the people of Corazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum would be punished more severely than the people of Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom.The people, who lived in the towns [MTY] in the area where Jesus was, saw him perform many miracles.

On the contrary, after you die, you will be sent {God will send you} down into the place where sinful people will be punished {he will punish sinful people} forever! God destroyed the ancient city of Sodom because the people who lived in that city were extremely wicked. If I had performed in Sodom the miracles that I performed in your city, the people there would have turned away from their wicked behavior and their city [MET] would still exist now [MTY]. But you, although I did miracles in your city, did not turn from your wicked behavior."},{"number":24,"verse":"So note this: God will punish the people who lived in Sodom city [MTY], but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges all people.”"},{"number":25,"verse":"Jesus thanked God for revealing his truth to uneducated people, and he urged the people to come to him to get rid of the burden of trying to obey religious laws.At that time Jesus prayed, “Father, you rule over everything in heaven and on the earth.

And as a result, you will quit worrying about obeying all the religious laws, and your spirits will be at peace.”"}]}
