They went in order to bring from there to Jerusalem the sacred chest, which had the name of Yahweh, the leader of the armies of the angels in heaven, written on it, and which had the statues of the winged creatures on top of it. Between those statues was where Yahweh spoke messages about ruling his people [MTY]."},{"number":3,"verse":"The sacred chest was in the house of Abinadab, on top of a hill. They went there, and they put the chest on a new cart.

So Uzzah put his hand on the sacred chest to ◄steady it/prevent it from falling off the cart►."},{"number":7,"verse":"Yahweh immediately became very angry with Uzzah, and he killed him right there alongside the sacred chest, because he had touched the chest, and Yahweh had commanded that only the descendants of Levi who help the priests should touch the sacred chest."},{"number":8,"verse":"David was angry because Yahweh had punished Uzzah. So ever since that time, that place has been called 'The Punishment of Uzzah.'"},{"number":9,"verse":"David was also afraid of what else Yahweh would do to punish them, so he said, “◄How can I take the sacred chest with me to Jerusalem?/I am afraid to take the sacred chest with me to Jerusalem.►” [RHQ]"},{"number":10,"verse":"So he did not want to take the sacred chest to Jerusalem. Instead, they took it to another place; they took it to the house of Obed-Edom, from Gath city."},{"number":11,"verse":"They left the sacred chest in the house of Obed-Edom for three months, and during that time Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom and his family."},{"number":12,"verse":"Later, people told David, “Yahweh has blessed Obed-Edom and his family because he is taking care of the sacred chest!” When David heard that, he and some other men went to Obed-Edom's house, and very joyfully brought the sacred chest from there to Jerusalem."},{"number":13,"verse":"When the men who were carrying the sacred chest had walked only six steps, they stopped, and there David killed a bull and a fat calf, and offered them to Yahweh for a sacrifice."},{"number":14,"verse":"David was wearing only a linen cloth wrapped around his waist, and was dancing very energetically to honor Yahweh."},{"number":15,"verse":"David and the Israeli men took the sacred chest up to Jerusalem, shouting loudly and blowing trumpets."},{"number":16,"verse":"While they were carrying the sacred chest into the city, David's wife Michal, who was Saul's daughter, looked out the window of her house.
