O, Absalom, my son! My son!”"},{"number":5,"verse":"Then Joab entered the room where the king was, and said to the king, “Today you have caused your soldiers to be ashamed! You have humiliated the men who saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and your ordinary wives and your slave wives!"},{"number":6,"verse":"It seems that you love those who hate you and that you hate those who love you. You have caused it to be clear today that your commanders and your officers are not at all important to you. I think that if Absalom were still alive and we were all dead today, you would be happy."},{"number":7,"verse":"So, now go and thank your soldiers for what they did. Because I solemnly declare that if you do not do that, none of them will still be with you by tomorrow morning and that would be worse for you than all the disasters/troubles that you have experienced since you were a boy.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"So the king got up and went and sat near the city gate. And all the people were told, “Hey, the king is sitting at the gate!” So they all came and gathered around him.

But now he has fled from Absalom and left Israel!"},{"number":10,"verse":"We appointed [MTY] Absalom to be our king, but he died in the battle against David's soldiers. So ◄why does someone not try to bring King David back?/surely someone should try to bring King David back.►” [RHQ]"},{"number":11,"verse":"King David found out what the people were saying. So he sent the two priests, Zadok and Abiathar, to say to the leaders of Judah, “The king says that he has heard that all the Israeli people want him to be king again.

As the king was about to cross the river, Shimei came to him and prostrated himself in front of the king."},{"number":19,"verse":"He said to the king, “Your Majesty, please forgive me. Please do not keep thinking about the terrible thing that I did on the day that you left Jerusalem. Do not think about it anymore."},{"number":20,"verse":"Because I know that I have sinned. Look, I have come today, the first one from the northern tribes to come here to greet you today, Your Majesty.”"},{"number":21,"verse":"But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said, “He cursed the one that Yahweh appointed [MTY] to be the king! So ◄should he not be executed for doing that?/he certainly should be executed for doing that.►” [RHQ]"},{"number":22,"verse":"But David said, “You sons of Zeruiah, what am I going to do with you? (OR, you are not the ones who should decide what to do to him). It is as though you have become my enemies today. I know that I am the one who has now become the king of Israel, so I say that certainly no one [RHQ] in Israel should be executed today.”"},{"number":23,"verse":"Then the king said to Shimei, “I solemnly promise that I will not execute you.”"},{"number":24,"verse":"Then Miphibosheth, Saul's grandson, came down to the river to greet the king.

But, Your Majesty, you are as wise as God's angel. So do whatever seems right to you."},{"number":28,"verse":"All of my grandfather's family expected/deserved that we would be executed.

I do not [RHQ] know what is enjoyable and what is not enjoyable. I cannot [RHQ] enjoy what I eat and what I drink. I cannot [RHQ] hear the voices of men and women as they sing.

But here is my son Chimham. Your Majesty, allow him to go with you and serve you, and do for him whatever seems good to you!”"},{"number":38,"verse":"The king replied, “Okay, he will cross the river with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you.

So it is ten times more right for us to say that David is our king than it is for you to say that. So why are you despising us [RHQ]? We were certainly [RHQ] the first ones to talk about bringing David back to Jerusalem to be our king again.” But the men of Judah spoke more harshly than the men from the other tribes of Israel did."}]}
