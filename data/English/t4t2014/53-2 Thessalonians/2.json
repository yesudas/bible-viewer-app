Do not be shaken or alarmed/worried by any such message. It does not matter if it is a message that someone claims God's Spirit revealed to him, or if it is some other message that someone has spoken, or whether it is a message that someone claims that I wrote in a letter."},{"number":3,"verse":"Do not allow anyone to deceive you in any way with the result that you believe any such message. The Lord will come only after that time when the man who will sin very greatly will appear. The Lord will not come [MTY] immediately. First, many people [PRS] will rebel against God. The result of their rebelling will be that they will accept and obey the man who will sin very greatly against God."},{"number":4,"verse":"He will be the supreme enemy of God. He will proudly exalt himself above everything that people consider to be God and above everything that people worship. As a result of wanting people to worship him, he will even enter God's Temple and sit down there to rule! He will publicly proclaim that he himself is God!

Then the Lord Jesus, by what he commands [MTY], will destroy him. Jesus, by his own glorious arrival, will cause him to become completely powerless."},{"number":9,"verse":"When this man is present, he will completely deceive those who will perish.But before Jesus destroys him, Satan will give him very great power.
