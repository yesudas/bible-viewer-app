That is the first law that God commanded in which he also promised something. He promised,"},{"number":3,"verse":"If you do that, you will prosper, and you will live a long time on the earth."},{"number":4,"verse":"You parents (OR, You fathers), do not treat your children so severely that they become angry. Instead, bring them up well by instructing them and by disciplining them in the manner that the Lord Jesus wants you to do."},{"number":5,"verse":"You slaves, obey those who are your masters here on the earth. Obey them very respectfully and sincerely [DOU], just like you obey Christ."},{"number":6,"verse":"Obey them, not only when they are watching [MTY] you, and not only to cause them to think highly/well of you. Instead, obey them as though you were [MET] slaves of Christ, not slaves of your masters. Do enthusiastically what God wants you to do."},{"number":7,"verse":"Serve your masters zealously/wholeheartedly, as you would serve the Lord Jesus, not as you would serve ordinary people."},{"number":8,"verse":"Do this because you know that some day the Lord Jesus will reward each person for whatever good deeds that person has done.

Stop threatening to beat them if they do not do their work well. Do not forget that the one who is their Lord and your Lord is in heaven.

Do that in order that you may be able to resist successfully the devil and all his powerful evil spirits [MTY] every time they ◄attack you/tempt you to sin or cause something bad to happen to you►.
