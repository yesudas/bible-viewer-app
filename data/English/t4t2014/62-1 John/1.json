He is the one who taught us the message that enables people to have eternal life (OR, live spiritually)."},{"number":2,"verse":"Because he came here to the earth and we have seen him, we proclaim to you clearly that the one whom we have seen is the one who has always lived.

If we do that, we have a close relationship with each other. Not only that, but God ◄acquits us/removes the guilt► of all our sins because he accepts what his Son Jesus did for us when his blood flowed from his body when he died.
