There was a large stone covering the top of the well."},{"number":3,"verse":"When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would work together to roll the stone away from the top of the well and get water for the sheep.

Look! Here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep!”"},{"number":7,"verse":"Jacob said, “Hey! The sun is still high in the sky. It is not time for the flocks to be gathered for nighttime. Give the sheep some water and then take them back to ◄graze/eat grass► in the pastures!”"},{"number":8,"verse":"They replied, “No, we cannot do that until all the flocks are gathered here and the stone is removed from the top of the well.

But Rachel was not able to become pregnant."},{"number":32,"verse":"Leah gave birth to a son, whom she named Reuben, which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean 'Look, a son !' She said, “Yahweh has seen that I was miserable, and because of that he has given me a son. Now, surely my husband will love me for giving birth to a son for him.”"},{"number":33,"verse":"Later she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son.
