They will be my wages."},{"number":33,"verse":"In that way, in the future, you will be able to know whether I have been honest regarding what you have paid me.

And when his female sheep mated, he made them look toward the animals that belonged to Laban that had black and white stripes on them, and the dark-colored animals. He did that so that the female sheep would give birth to animals that were striped or dark-colored. By doing that, he made bigger flocks for himself, and he kept them separate from Laban's flocks."},{"number":41,"verse":"In addition, whenever the stronger female sheep were ready to mate, Jacob put some of those peeled branches in the troughs in front of them, so that they would mate in front of the branches."},{"number":42,"verse":"But when weak animals were ready to mate, he did not put the branches in their troughs. So the weak ones became part of Laban's flock, and the strong ones became part of Jacob's flock."},{"number":43,"verse":"As a result, Jacob became very rich. He owned many large flocks and many male and female slaves and camels and donkeys."}]}
