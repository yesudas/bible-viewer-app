I do not say this because I desire your gifts, but I desire that God would abundantly bless you for aiding me.) My friends there at Philippi, you yourselves know that during the time I first proclaimed the message about Christ to you, when I left there to go to Macedonia province, you were the only group of believers [LIT] who sent me gifts [EUP] in order that I might proclaim that message to others just like I did for you."},{"number":16,"verse":"Even when I was in Thessalonica city, you sent money [EUP] to me two different times [IDM] in order to supply what I needed."},{"number":17,"verse":"I say this, not because I desire that you give me money now.

Let us praise him forever.) I have received a very generous gift [EUP] from you, and as a result, I have plenty.
