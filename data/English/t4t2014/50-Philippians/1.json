You started doing that when you first [MTY] believed it, and you have continued doing it until now."},{"number":6,"verse":"I am completely confident that God, who has begun to perform in you what is good, (OR, that since God has begun to perform in you what is good, he) will continue to do that until he finishes doing it on the day Christ Jesus [MTY] returns."},{"number":7,"verse":"During this time that I have been a prisoner [MTY] and during the times I was previously able to defend the good message about Christ and proved/confirmed to others that it is true, all of you have been sharing with me (OR, have helped me) in this work that God kindly gave to me to do. So indeed it is right that I feel joyful about you all, because you are very dear [IDM] to me."},{"number":8,"verse":"God can verify that Christ Jesus causes me to love and long for all of you very much, just like Christ loves you."},{"number":9,"verse":"I pray that God will enable you to know how to love one another more and more appropriately and to completely understand how you should believe and act.And what I pray for you is that God will enable you to truly know and discern how to love one another more and more in a proper way in every situation."},{"number":10,"verse":"And I pray that he will enable you to completely understand how you should believe and act.

Instead, these things that I have experienced have enabled even more people to hear the good message about Christ."},{"number":13,"verse":"Specifically, all the military guards who are stationed here in Rome and many other [HYP] people in this city [HYP] now know that I am a prisoner [MTY] because I proclaim the good news about Christ."},{"number":14,"verse":"Also, most of the believers here now proclaim the message from God more courageously and fearlessly because they trust the Lord more firmly to help them.

I will continue to rejoice because I know that I will remain completely victorious spiritually because I earnestly expect to boldly honor Christ whether I live or die. Furthermore, I will continue to rejoice,"},{"number":19,"verse":"because I know that the outcome of these troubles that I am experiencing will be that some day God will say that he approves of what I have done (OR, that the Roman authorities will set me free). This will happen as a result of your praying for me, and as a result of God's Spirit, whom Jesus Christ gave me, helping me."},{"number":20,"verse":"I know that this will happen because I very confidently expect [DOU] that in no way I will be reluctant to honor Christ. Instead, just like I always have done, Christ will be greatly honored {I will continue now also to very boldly honor Christ} by means of all that I do [SYN, MTY], whether by the way I live or by the way I die."},{"number":21,"verse":"As for me, I live in order to honor Christ. But if I die, it will be better for me than if I continue to live, because then I will be completely united with him."},{"number":22,"verse":"On the other hand, if I continue to live, that will enable me to continue to serve Christ effectively. As a result, I do not know whether I prefer to live or to die."},{"number":23,"verse":"That is, I am not sure which of those two I prefer.

Do that in order that whether I come and see you, or whether I am away from you and people tell me about you, what I hear or see will make me happy. They will tell me that you are unitedly and cooperatively resisting those who oppose the message about Christ (OR, oppose you). I will know that you are not allowing others to influence you to believe a message that is different from the good message about Christ."},{"number":28,"verse":"And I will know that you are not at all frightened by {afraid of} the people who oppose you. This will show/prove to those people that God will destroy them, but this will show/prove to you that God will save you eternally.
