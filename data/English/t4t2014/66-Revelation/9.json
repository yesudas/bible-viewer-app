He was given {Someone gave him} the key to the shaft that descended ◄to the underworld/to the deep dark pit►."},{"number":2,"verse":"When he opened that shaft, smoke arose from it like smoke from a great burning furnace. The smoke prevented anyone from seeing the light of the sun and the sky."},{"number":3,"verse":"Locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth. They were given {God gave them} power to sting people, like scorpions sting people."},{"number":4,"verse":"God told the locusts that they should not harm the grass of the earth, nor any plants, nor any tree. God said that they should harm only those people who did not have a mark on the forehead to show that they belonged to God."},{"number":5,"verse":"God did not allow the locusts to kill those people. Instead, he allowed them to continue torturing people for five months. When they tortured people, the pain those people felt was like the pain a scorpion causes when it stings someone."},{"number":6,"verse":"During the time when the locusts torture rebellious people, the pain will be so bad that people will want to find a way to die, but they will not find [PRS] any way.

Their power to harm people during those five months was in their tails."},{"number":11,"verse":"The king who ruled over them was the angel of the underworld.

Be aware that two tragic events are still to come."},{"number":13,"verse":"When the sixth angel blew his trumpet, a third of the rebellious people on earth died. But the rest of the rebels did not repent of their false worship or of their evil practices.The sixth angel blew his trumpet. Then I heard a voice from the four corners of the golden altar that is in God's presence."},{"number":14,"verse":"It was saying to the sixth angel, the one who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels whom I have bound at the great river Euphrates.”"},{"number":15,"verse":"The four angels were released, those who had been {He released the four angels, whom God had} kept ready for that exact hour of that day, of that month, of that year.

I heard someone say how many there were."},{"number":17,"verse":"In the vision I saw what the horses and the beings that rode them looked like.
