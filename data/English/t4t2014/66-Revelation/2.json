He also said to me, “Write this message to the leader [MET] of the congregation in Ephesus city: ‘I am saying these things to you: I am the one who firmly holds the seven stars in my right hand. I am the one who walks among the seven golden lampstands."},{"number":2,"verse":"I know what you do: You labor for me intensely, and you continue to serve me steadfastly. I know that you cannot tolerate people who teach what is evil [MTY], and that you investigated people who falsely claimed that they are apostles, and you found that they were lying."},{"number":3,"verse":"I know also that you continue to serve me steadfastly. Even when people ◄caused you to suffer/persecuted you►, you continued to serve me because you believe in me, and you have not become too tired to keep on serving me."},{"number":4,"verse":"Nevertheless, I have this complaint against you: You no longer love each other and me as you did when you first [MTY] trusted in me."},{"number":5,"verse":"So, I tell you to remember how you used to love me and each other, and to realize that you no longer love as you did. I tell you to turn away from your sin of not loving me and each other, and start loving each other and me again as you did at first. If you do not turn away from your sinful behavior, I will come to judge you and cause your group to cease to be a Christian congregation [MET]."},{"number":6,"verse":"But you have the following good quality: Those Nicolaitans teach you believers that you can worship idols and that you may act immorally. However, you hate such teaching, just like I also hate it."},{"number":7,"verse":"Everyone who wants to understand my message [MTY] must listen carefully to the message that God's Spirit speaks to the congregations.

I am the one who died and became alive again."},{"number":9,"verse":"I know that you suffer because of what unbelievers do to you, and that you lack material possessions. But I also know that you are spiritually [MET] rich. I know that people ◄slander/say evil things about► you. They say that they are Jews, but I do not consider that they are Jews. I consider that they belong to the assembly that Satan controls!"},{"number":10,"verse":"Do not be afraid of any of the things that you are about to suffer. The truth is that the devil is about to put some of you in prison, to tempt you to deny that you believe in me. For a short period of time you will suffer because of what people will do to you [MTY]. Continue to trust in me, even if they kill you because you trust in me. As a result, I will reward you with eternal life, just like [MET] people reward a victorious athlete by putting a wreath on his head."},{"number":11,"verse":"Everyone who wants to understand [MTY] must listen carefully to the message that God's Spirit speaks to the congregations. After those who conquer Satan die, they will live with God.

You did not deny that you believe/trust in me, not even in the time when Antipas, ◄my faithful witness/who faithfully told people about me►, was alive. He was killed {People killed him} in your city, a city where people habitually obey Satan."},{"number":14,"verse":"Nevertheless, I have this complaint against you: You permit some of your members to teach things like Balaam taught long ago. He taught Balak to persuade the Israelite people to sin. Specifically, he taught them to eat food that had been offered to idols, and to practice sexual immorality."},{"number":15,"verse":"In that way, you are also permitting some of your members to practice what the Nicolaitans teach, which is like what Balaam taught."},{"number":16,"verse":"So you must stop doing this. If you do not stop doing it, I will come to you suddenly. With the words that I will speak I will fight against those who believe this false teaching [MTY], and I will ◄condemn them/say that they must be punished►."},{"number":17,"verse":"Everyone who wants to understand [MTY] must listen carefully to the message that God's Spirit speaks to the congregations. To everyone who conquers Satan, I will give blessings that will be like the food called manna that is in a jar that is {that someone has} hidden. I will also give them a white stone on which I will engrave a new name, a name that no one but the ones who receive it will know.’ ”"},{"number":18,"verse":"Christ rebukes the congregation at Thyatira for tolerating a teacher who encourages sexual immorality and eating food offered to idols.

She says that she ◄is a prophetess/proclaims messages that come directly from God►, but by what she teaches she is deceiving my servants. She is urging them to practice sexual immorality and to eat food that they have offered to idols."},{"number":21,"verse":"Although I gave her time to turn away from her sexual immorality and pagan practices, she did not want to stop doing them."},{"number":22,"verse":"Take notice that as a result, I will cause her to become very ill [MTY]. I will also cause those who act immorally as she does [MET] to suffer greatly, if they do not stop doing what she does."},{"number":23,"verse":"Some have become like her children by accepting what she teaches [MET]; I will certainly get rid of them.
