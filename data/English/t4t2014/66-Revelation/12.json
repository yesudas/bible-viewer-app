Now his Messiah, who is the supreme ruler whom God appointed, has authority to rule all people, because our God has thrown out of heaven the one who accuses our fellow believers! The dragon is the one who accuses them day and night before our God, saying that they have sinned and that God ought punish them."},{"number":11,"verse":"Our fellow believers overcame him because they never stopped trusting (OR, never stopped telling people about) Jesus, and because they trusted in what the one who is like a lamb accomplished when his blood flowed when he died.
