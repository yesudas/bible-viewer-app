Avoid such people.) You need to realize that during the last days [MTY] before Christ returns, evil people will make it difficult for believers to behave as they should."},{"number":2,"verse":"This is because such evil people will be habitually loving themselves and loving money. They will habitually boast about themselves, they will be proud, and will often say bad things about others. They will disobey their parents. They will not be thankful, nor will they respect anything that is good."},{"number":3,"verse":"They will not even love their own family, nor agree with anybody (OR, they never forgive anyone). They will tell lies about people. They will not control what they say and do, nor allow anyone to control them. They will not love anything that is good."},{"number":4,"verse":"They will ◄betray others/hand others over to their enemies► and act foolishly. They will be overly/very proud of themselves, and they will love to please themselves instead of loving God."},{"number":5,"verse":"And, although they will pretend that they worship God, they will not let God's Spirit work powerfully in their lives. Do not associate with such people (OR, Do not let such people join your congregation),"},{"number":6,"verse":"because some such people, even now, subtly/deceivingly persuade foolish women to let them come into their houses, and then they deceive those women so that they control what those women think.

Those people think only what is evil. God rejects them because they do not believe what is true."},{"number":9,"verse":"Nevertheless, they will not continue to succeed, because most [HYP] people will understand clearly that such people are foolish, just like people also realized clearly that Jannes and Jambres were foolish."},{"number":10,"verse":"(Continue to believe what you have learned and been assured of.) But as for yourself, you have fully known what I have taught. You have known and imitated the way in which I conducted my life, and what I have been trying to do. You have trusted God as I have You have been patient as I have been. You have loved people as I have and you have endured as you suffered like I have suffered."},{"number":11,"verse":"You know how I endured many times when people harmed me. They caused me to suffer at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra cities.
