[DOU]”"},{"number":4,"verse":"So those officials went to the king and said, “This man Jeremiah should be executed! Because of what he is saying, he is discouraging our soldiers who remain in the city. He is also discouraging the people. He is not saying things that will help us; he is saying things that will defeat us.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"King Zedekiah said, “All right, do to him what you want to; I do not have the power to stop you.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"So those officials took me from my cell and lowered me by ropes into a well in the courtyard. The well belonged to Malkijah, who was a son of the king. There was no water in the well, but there was a lot of mud, so I sank down deep into the mud."},{"number":7,"verse":"But Ebed-Melech, a palace official from Ethiopia, heard someone say that I was in the well.

And as surely as Yahweh lives, I will not cause you to be executed, and I will not put you into the hands of those who are wanting to kill you.”"},{"number":17,"verse":"So then I said to Zedekiah, “This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels the God whom we Israelis worship, says: ‘If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, you and your family will ◄be spared/not be killed►, and this city will not be burned."},{"number":18,"verse":"But if you refuse to surrender to them, you will not escape. And the army from Babylonia will capture this city and completely burn it.’ ”"},{"number":19,"verse":"The king replied, “But I am afraid to surrender to the soldiers from Babylon, because their officers may put me into the hands of the people of Judah who have already joined the soldiers from Babylonia, and those people from Judah will mistreat me.”"},{"number":20,"verse":"I replied, “If you obey Yahweh by doing what I tell you to do, they will not put you into the hands of our people.
