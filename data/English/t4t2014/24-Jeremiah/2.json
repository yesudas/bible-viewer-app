You tried to please me like a bride tries to please her husband; You loved me, and you followed me through the desert [DOU]."},{"number":3,"verse":"At that time you Israelis ◄were set apart/belonged only► to me; you belonged to me like the first part of the harvests belong to me [MET]. I promised to punish all those who harmed you, my people, and truly I did send disasters on them. That happened because I, Yahweh, said that it would happen.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"So, you descendants of [MTY] Jacob, all you people of [MTY] Israel,"},{"number":5,"verse":"listen to what Yahweh says: “◄What sin did I commit [RHQ] that caused your ancestors to turn far away from me?/Though your ancestors found no fault in me, they turned far away from me.► They worshiped worthless idols, and they themselves became worthless."},{"number":6,"verse":"They did not say, ‘Yahweh brought us safely out of Egypt, and he led us through a desert where there were a lot of pits; he led us where there was no water and where it was very dangerous, through a land where no one lives, and no one even travels. ◄So where is Yahweh now?/So he should be helping us now!► [RHQ]’"},{"number":7,"verse":"And when I brought you into a very fertile land, in order that you could enjoy all the fruit and other good things that you would harvest, you caused the land that I promised to give to you to be unfit for me and to become disgusting/detestable to me."},{"number":8,"verse":"Your priests also did not say, ‘◄Where is Yahweh now?/Yahweh should be helping us now!►’ [RHQ] Those who teach/explain God's laws do not want to know me, and your leaders have rebelled against me. Your prophets gave you messages from their god Baal, and they worship worthless idols.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"Yahweh accused the Israeli people“So, I will accuse you in court. In future years, I will say what your children and your grandchildren have done that is wrong.
