No one will gather up their bones and bury them again; they will remain scattered on the ground like dung."},{"number":3,"verse":"And all the people of this wicked nation who are still alive and whom I have exiled to other countries will say, ‘We would prefer to die than to continue to stay alive here in these countries.’ That will be true because I, Yahweh, have said it.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"(The people will not admit their sins) Yahweh said to me, “Jeremiah, tell the people that this is what I, Yahweh, am saying to them: ‘When people fall down, they get up again, do they not [RHQ]? When people are going along a road and find out that they are walking on the wrong road, they go back and find the correct road, do they not [RHQ]?"},{"number":5,"verse":"Yes, they do, so why do these people of Judah continue trusting in those idols that have deceived them? They continue turning away from me, even though I have warned them."},{"number":6,"verse":"I have listened carefully [DOU] to what they say, but they do not say what they should say.

Truly, they were not [RHQ] very wise to do that!"},{"number":10,"verse":"So, I will give their wives to other men; I will give their fields to the enemy soldiers who conquer them.
