The servants return with empty pitchers; they cover their heads because they are ashamed and humiliated/disappointed and sad."},{"number":4,"verse":"The ground is extremely dry and cracked open because there has been no rain. The farmers are very worried, so they also cover their heads."},{"number":5,"verse":"Even the ◄does/female deer► abandon their newborn babies/fawns because there is no grass in the fields for them to eat."},{"number":6,"verse":"The wild donkeys stand on the barren hills, panting like [SIM] thirsty jackals/wolves.

So, why do you not help us? You act as though you are a stranger in our land, like you are someone who is staying here for only one night."},{"number":9,"verse":"Are you also surprised about the terrible things that are happening to us? Why do you act like you are unable to save anyone, even though you are a strong warrior?

I did not send them, so what they are saying is false. They say that they have received visions from me, and that they are telling things that I have revealed to them, but that is not true. They are saying foolish things that they have only thought of themselves."},{"number":15,"verse":"So this is what I say about those prophets who are predicting what will happen, saying that I told them those things: They are saying that we Israelis will not die from wars or famines, but I did not send those prophets. And they themselves will die from wars or from famines."},{"number":16,"verse":"And the people to whom they are predicting these things, they and their wives and their sons and their daughters, will also die from wars or from famines. Their corpses will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem, and there will not be anyone to bury them.

Do you really despise the people of Jerusalem [MTY]? Why have you [RHQ] wounded us very badly, with the result that we will never be healed? We hoped that we would have peace, but there was no peace. We hoped that there would be a time when we would be healed, but all that we received were things that terrified us."},{"number":20,"verse":"Yahweh, we admit/know that we are wicked people, and that our ancestors also did many wicked things. We have all sinned against you."},{"number":21,"verse":"But Yahweh, in order that we may honor [MTY] you, do not despise/abandon us. Do not dishonor the city where [MTY] your glorious throne is.
