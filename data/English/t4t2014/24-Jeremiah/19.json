Then give them a message."},{"number":3,"verse":"Say to them, ‘This message is for you kings of Judah and other people of Jerusalem. Listen to what Yahweh is saying! The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says that he will bring a terrible disaster on Jerusalem. Those who hear about it will be stunned/shocked [IDI]."},{"number":4,"verse":"That will happen because you Israeli people have stopped worshiping me, and have caused this place to be a place where you worship foreign gods.
