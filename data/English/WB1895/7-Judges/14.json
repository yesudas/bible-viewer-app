You might as well speak into the air."},{"number":10,"verse":"There are, for example, many kinds of sounds in the world and none of them are without meaning."},{"number":11,"verse":"Therefore if I don't know what the sound means, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker will be a foreigner to me."},{"number":12,"verse":"And so you (since you are so desirous for spiritual gifts) seek, so that you may use it to the fullest for edifying the congregation."},{"number":13,"verse":"So then let him who speaks in an unknown language, pray that he may interpret."},{"number":14,"verse":"For if I pray in an unknown language, my spirit prays but my understanding is unfruitful."},{"number":15,"verse":"So what is best? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding, too.
