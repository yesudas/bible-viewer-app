Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains on the vine, so you can't either unless you remain attached to me."},{"number":5,"verse":"\"I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains attached to me (and I to him) will bare much fruit, for you can do nothing without me."},{"number":6,"verse":"\"If someone does not remain attached to me, he is thrown out just like a branch and dries up, then men gather them and throw then into the fire, where they are burned."},{"number":7,"verse":"\"If you remain attached to me, and my words remain in you, you will ask what you want, and it will be done for you."},{"number":8,"verse":"\"My Father is glorified by this: that you bear much fruit, and you will become my disciples."},{"number":9,"verse":"\"Just as the Father has loved me, so I have loved you.
