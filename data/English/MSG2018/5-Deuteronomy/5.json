GOD spoke to you personally out of the fire on the mountain. At the time I stood between GOD and you, to tell you what GOD said.

Don’t bow down to them and don’t serve them because I am GOD, your God, and I’m a most jealous God.

That way your servants and maids will get the same rest as you. Don’t ever forget that you were slaves in Egypt and GOD, your God, got you out of there in a powerful show of strength.

He spoke in a tremendous voice from the fire and cloud and dark mist. And that was it. No more words.

We’ve heard him speak from the fire today! We’ve seen that God can speak to humans and they can still live. But why risk it further? This huge fire will devour us if we stay around any longer.
