David asked, “What brings you here?” He answered, “I’ve just escaped from the camp of Israel.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"“So what happened?” said David. “What’s the news?” He said, “The Israelites have fled the battlefield, leaving a lot of their dead comrades behind. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"David pressed the young soldier for details: “How do you know for sure that Saul and Jonathan are dead?”"},{"number":6,"verse":"“I just happened by Mount Gilboa and came on Saul, badly wounded and leaning on his spear, with enemy chariots and horsemen bearing down hard on him. He looked behind him, saw me, and called me to him. ‘Yes sir,’ I said, ‘at your service.’ He asked me who I was, and I told him, ‘I’m an Amalekite.’”"},{"number":9,"verse":"“Come here,” he said, “and put me out of my misery. I’m nearly dead already, but my life hangs on.”"},{"number":10,"verse":"“So I did what he asked—I killed him. I knew he wouldn’t last much longer anyway.

Don’t announce it in the city of Gath, don’t post the news in the streets of Ashkelon. Don’t give those coarse Philistine girls one more excuse for a drunken party! No more dew or rain for you, hills of Gilboa, and not a drop from springs and wells, For there the warriors’ shields were dragged through the mud, Saul’s shield left there to rot."},{"number":22,"verse":"Jonathan’s bow was bold— the bigger they were the harder they fell.
