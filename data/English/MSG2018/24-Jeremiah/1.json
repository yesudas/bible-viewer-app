And it continued to come to him clear down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah over Judah, the year that Jerusalem was taken into exile. This is what GOD said:"},{"number":5,"verse":"“Before I shaped you in the womb, I knew all about you. Before you saw the light of day, I had holy plans for you: A prophet to the nations— that’s what I had in mind for you.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"But I said, “Hold it, Master GOD! Look at me. I don’t know anything. I’m only a boy!”"},{"number":7,"verse":"GOD told me, “Don’t say, ‘I’m only a boy.’ I’ll tell you where to go and you’ll go there. I’ll tell you what to say and you’ll say it. Don’t be afraid of a soul. I’ll be right there, looking after you.” GOD’s Decree."},{"number":9,"verse":"GOD reached out, touched my mouth, and said, “Look! I’ve just put my words in your mouth—hand-delivered! See what I’ve done? I’ve given you a job to do among nations and governments—a red-letter day! Your job is to pull up and tear down, take apart and demolish, And then start over, building and planting.”"},{"number":11,"verse":"(Stand Up and Say Your Piece) GOD’s Message came to me: “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “A walking stick—that’s all.” And GOD said, “Good eyes! I’m sticking with you.

Stand up and say your piece. Say exactly what I tell you to say. Don’t pull your punches or I’ll pull you out of the lineup."},{"number":18,"verse":"“Stand at attention while I prepare you for your work. I’m making you as impregnable as a castle, Immovable as a steel post, solid as a concrete block wall.

I’ll back you up every inch of the way.” GOD’s Decree."}]}
