God sticks his head out of heaven. He looks around. He’s looking for someone not stupid— one man, even, God-expectant, just one God-ready woman."},{"number":3,"verse":"He comes up empty. A string of zeros. Useless, unshepherded Sheep, taking turns pretending to be Shepherd. The ninety and nine follow the one."},{"number":4,"verse":"Don’t they know anything, all these predators? Don’t they know they can’t get away with this, Treating people like a fast-food meal over which they’re too busy to pray?"},{"number":5,"verse":"Night is coming for them, and nightmare— a nightmare they’ll never wake up from. God will make hash of these squatters, send them packing for good."},{"number":6,"verse":"Is there anyone around to save Israel? God turns life around. Turned-around Jacob skips rope, turned-around Israel sings laughter."}]}
