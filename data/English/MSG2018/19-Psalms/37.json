GOD loves this kind of thing, never turns away from his friends."},{"number":28,"verse":"Live this way and you’ve got it made, but bad eggs will be tossed out. The good get planted on good land and put down healthy roots."},{"number":30,"verse":"Righteous chews on wisdom like a dog on a bone, rolls virtue around on his tongue. His heart pumps God’s Word like blood through his veins; his feet are as sure as a cat’s."},{"number":32,"verse":"Wicked sets a watch for Righteous, he’s out for the kill.

GOD-strengthened, we’re delivered from evil— when we run to him, he saves us."}]}
