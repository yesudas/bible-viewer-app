Your people will freely join you, resplendent in holy armor on the great day of your conquest, Join you at the fresh break of day, join you with all the vigor of youth."},{"number":4,"verse":"GOD gave his word and he won’t take it back: you’re the permanent priest, the Melchizedek priest.

The King-Maker put his King on the throne; the True King rules with head held high!"}]}
