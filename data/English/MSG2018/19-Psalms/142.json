Look right, look left— there’s not a soul who cares what happens! I’m up against the wall, with no exit— it’s just me, all alone. I cry out, GOD, call out: ‘You’re my last chance, my only hope for life!’ Oh listen, please listen; I’ve never been this low. Rescue me from those who are hunting me down; I’m no match for them. Get me out of this dungeon so I can thank you in public. Your people will form a circle around me and you’ll bring me showers of blessing!”"}]}
