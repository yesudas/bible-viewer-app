{"bibleAbbr":"MSG2018","bookName":"Psalms","bookEnglishName":"Psalms","chapterNumber":94,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"GOD, put an end to evil; avenging God, show your colors! Judge of the earth, take your stand; throw the book at the arrogant."},{"number":3,"verse":"GOD, the wicked get away with murder— how long will you let this go on? They brag and boast and crow about their crimes!"},{"number":5,"verse":"They walk all over your people, GOD, exploit and abuse your precious people. They take out anyone who gets in their way; if they can’t use them, they kill them. They think, “GOD isn’t looking, Jacob’s God is out to lunch.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"Well, think again, you idiots, fools—how long before you get smart? Do you think Ear-Maker doesn’t hear, Eye-Shaper doesn’t see? Do you think the trainer of nations doesn’t correct, the teacher of Adam doesn’t know? GOD knows, all right— knows your stupidity, sees your shallowness."},{"number":12,"verse":"How blessed the man you train, GOD, the woman you instruct in your Word, Providing a circle of quiet within the clamor of evil, while a jail is being built for the wicked. GOD will never walk away from his people, never desert his precious people. Rest assured that justice is on its way and every good heart put right."},{"number":16,"verse":"Who stood up for me against the wicked? Who took my side against evil workers? If GOD hadn’t been there for me, I never would have made it. The minute I said, “I’m slipping, I’m falling,” your love, GOD, took hold and held me fast. When I was upset and beside myself, you calmed me down and cheered me up."},{"number":20,"verse":"Can Misrule have anything in common with you? Can Troublemaker pretend to be on your side? They ganged up on good people, plotted behind the backs of the innocent. But GOD became my hideout, God was my high mountain retreat, Then boomeranged their evil back on them: for their evil ways he wiped them out, our GOD cleaned them out for good."}]}
