Their plowmen plowed long furrows up and down my back; But GOD wouldn’t put up with it, he sticks with us. Then GOD ripped the harnesses of the evil plowmen to shreds.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"Oh, let all those who hate Zion grovel in humiliation; Let them be like grass in shallow ground that withers before the harvest, Before the farmhands can gather it in, the harvesters get in the crop, Before the neighbors have a chance to call out, “Congratulations on your wonderful crop! We bless you in GOD’s name!”"}]}
