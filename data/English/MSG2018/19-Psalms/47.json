{"bibleAbbr":"MSG2018","bookName":"Psalms","bookEnglishName":"Psalms","chapterNumber":47,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"Applause, everyone. Bravo, bravissimo! Shout God-songs at the top of your lungs! GOD Most High is stunning, astride land and ocean. He crushes hostile people, puts nations at our feet. He set us at the head of the line, prize-winning Jacob, his favorite. Loud cheers as God climbs the mountain, a ram’s horn blast at the summit. Sing songs to God, sing out! Sing to our King, sing praise! He’s Lord over earth, so sing your best songs to God. God is Lord of godless nations— sovereign, he’s King of the mountain. Princes from all over are gathered, people of Abraham’s God. The powers of earth are God’s— he soars over all."}]}
