{"bibleAbbr":"MSG2018","bookName":"Psalms","bookEnglishName":"Psalms","chapterNumber":149,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"Hallelujah! Sing to GOD a brand-new song, praise him in the company of all who love him. Let all Israel celebrate their Sovereign Creator, Zion’s children exult in their King. Let them praise his name in dance; strike up the band and make great music! And why? Because GOD delights in his people, adorns plain folk with salvation garlands!"},{"number":5,"verse":"Let true lovers break out in praise, sing out from wherever they’re sitting, Shout the high praises of God, brandish their swords in the wild sword-dance— A portent of vengeance on the God-defying nations, a signal that punishment’s coming, Their kings chained and hauled off to jail, their leaders behind bars for good, The judgment on them carried out to the letter —and all who love God in the seat of honor! Hallelujah!"}]}
