He listened so intently as I laid out my case before him. Death stared me in the face, hell was hard on my heels. Up against it, I didn’t know which way to turn; then I called out to GOD for help: “Please, GOD!” I cried out. “Save my life!” GOD is gracious—it is he who makes things right, our most compassionate God. GOD takes the side of the helpless; when I was at the end of my rope, he saved me."},{"number":7,"verse":"I said to myself, “Relax and rest. GOD has showered you with blessings. Soul, you’ve been rescued from death; Eye, you’ve been rescued from tears; And you, Foot, were kept from stumbling.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"I’m striding in the presence of GOD, alive in the land of the living! I stayed faithful, though overwhelmed, and despite a ton of bad luck, Despite giving up on the human race, saying, “They’re all liars and cheats.”"},{"number":12,"verse":"What can I give back to GOD for the blessings he’s poured out on me? I’ll lift high the cup of salvation—a toast to GOD! I’ll pray in the name of GOD; I’ll complete what I promised GOD I’d do, and I’ll do it together with his people. When they arrive at the gates of death, GOD welcomes those who love him. Oh, GOD, here I am, your servant, your faithful servant: set me free for your service! I’m ready to offer the thanksgiving sacrifice and pray in the name of GOD. I’ll complete what I promised GOD I’d do, and I’ll do it in company with his people, In the place of worship, in GOD’s house, in Jerusalem, GOD’s city. Hallelujah!"}]}
