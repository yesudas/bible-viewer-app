{"bibleAbbr":"MSG2018","bookName":"Psalms","bookEnglishName":"Psalms","chapterNumber":125,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"Those who trust in GOD are like Zion Mountain: Nothing can move it, a rock-solid mountain you can always depend on. Mountains encircle Jerusalem, and GOD encircles his peopleâ€” always has and always will. The fist of the wicked will never violate What is due the righteous, provoking wrongful violence. Be good to your good people, GOD, to those whose hearts are right! GOD will round up the backsliders, corral them with the incorrigibles. Peace over Israel!"}]}
