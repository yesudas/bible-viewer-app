{"bibleAbbr":"MSG2018","bookName":"Psalms","bookEnglishName":"Psalms","chapterNumber":66,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"All together now—applause for God! Sing songs to the tune of his glory, set glory to the rhythms of his praise. Say of God, “We’ve never seen anything like him!” When your enemies see you in action, they slink off like scolded dogs. The whole earth falls to its knees— it worships you, sings to you, can’t stop enjoying your name and fame."},{"number":5,"verse":"Take a good look at God’s wonders— they’ll take your breath away. He converted sea to dry land; travelers crossed the river on foot. Now isn’t that cause for a song?"},{"number":7,"verse":"Ever sovereign in his high tower, he keeps his eye on the godless nations. Rebels don’t dare raise a finger against him."},{"number":8,"verse":"Bless our God, O peoples! Give him a thunderous welcome! Didn’t he set us on the road to life? Didn’t he keep us out of the ditch? He trained us first, passed us like silver through refining fires, Brought us into hardscrabble country, pushed us to our very limit, Road-tested us inside and out, took us to hell and back; Finally he brought us to this well-watered place."},{"number":13,"verse":"I’m bringing my prizes and presents to your house. I’m doing what I said I’d do, What I solemnly swore I’d do that day when I was in so much trouble: The choicest cuts of meat for the sacrificial meal; Even the fragrance of roasted lamb is like a meal! Or make it an ox garnished with goat meat!"},{"number":16,"verse":"All believers, come here and listen, let me tell you what God did for me. I called out to him with my mouth, my tongue shaped the sounds of music. If I had been cozy with evil, the Lord would never have listened. But he most surely did listen, he came on the double when he heard my prayer. Blessed be God: he didn’t turn a deaf ear, he stayed with me, loyal in his love."}]}
