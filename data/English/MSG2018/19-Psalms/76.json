He keeps a house in Salem, his own suite of rooms in Zion. That’s where, using arrows for kindling, he made a bonfire of weapons of war."},{"number":4,"verse":"Oh, how bright you shine! Outshining their huge piles of loot! The warriors were plundered and left there impotent. And now there’s nothing to them, nothing to show for their swagger and threats. Your sudden roar, God of Jacob, knocked the wind out of horse and rider."},{"number":7,"verse":"Fierce you are, and fearsome! Who can stand up to your rising anger? From heaven you thunder judgment; earth falls to her knees and holds her breath. God stands tall and makes things right, he saves all the wretched on earth. Instead of smoldering rage—God-praise! All that sputtering rage—now a garland for God!"},{"number":11,"verse":"Do for GOD what you said you’d do— he is, after all, your God. Let everyone in town bring offerings to the One Who Watches our every move. Nobody gets by with anything, no one plays fast and loose with him."}]}
