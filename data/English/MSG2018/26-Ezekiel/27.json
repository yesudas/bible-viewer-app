They raise their funeral song: “Who on the high seas is like Tyre!”"},{"number":33,"verse":"“‘As you crisscrossed the seas with your products, you satisfied many peoples. Your worldwide trade made earth’s kings rich. And now you’re battered to bits by the waves, sunk to the bottom of the sea, And everything you’ve bought and sold has sunk to the bottom with you. Everyone on shore looks on in terror. The hair of kings stands on end, their faces drawn and haggard! The buyers and sellers of the world throw up their hands: This horror can’t happen! Oh, this has happened!’”"}]}
