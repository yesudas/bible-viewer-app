Is vine wood ever used to make anything? Is it used to make pegs to hang things from?"},{"number":4,"verse":"“I don’t think so. At best it’s good for fuel. Look at it: A flimsy piece of vine, thrown in the fire and then rescued—the ends burned off and the middle charred. Now is it good for anything?"},{"number":5,"verse":"“Hardly. When it was whole it wasn’t good for anything. Half-burned is no improvement. What’s it good for?"},{"number":6,"verse":"“So here’s the Message of GOD, the Master: Like the wood of the vine I selected from among the trees of the forest and used as fuel for the fire, just so I’ll treat those who live in Jerusalem. I am dead set against them. Even though at one time they got out of the fire charred, the fire’s going to burn them up. When I take my stand against them, you’ll realize that I am GOD. I’ll turn this country into a wilderness because they’ve been faithless.” Decree of GOD, the Master."}]}
