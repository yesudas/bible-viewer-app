They also celebrated the Festival of Booths as prescribed and the daily Whole-Burnt-Offerings set for each day. And they presented the regular Whole-Burnt-Offerings for Sabbaths, New Moons, and GOD’s Holy Festivals, as well as Freewill-Offerings for GOD."},{"number":6,"verse":"They began offering Whole-Burnt-Offerings to GOD from the very first day of the seventh month, even though The Temple of GOD’s foundation had not yet been laid."},{"number":7,"verse":"They gave money to hire masons and carpenters.

They sang antiphonally praise and thanksgiving to GOD: Yes! GOD is good! Oh yes—he’ll never quit loving Israel!"},{"number":11,"verse":"All the people boomed out hurrahs, praising GOD as the foundation of The Temple of GOD was laid. As many were noisily shouting with joy, many of the older priests, Levites, and family heads who had seen the first Temple, when they saw the foundations of this Temple laid, wept loudly for joy. People couldn’t distinguish the shouting from the weeping. The sound of their voices reverberated for miles around."}]}
