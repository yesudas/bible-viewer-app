(Who is this King of glory? the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.) (In the original “Wycliffe Old Testament”, but only in Psalms, numerous verses have the phrase “the Lord of virtues”/“the Lord God of virtues”, where “virtues” refers to “hosts” or armies. Here in Wycliffe’s Old Testament, these phrases become “the Lord of hosts”/“the Lord God of hosts”, to aid comprehension, and to make them consistent with the rest of the text.)"}]}
