Their thoughts are thoughts of wickedness [of sin, of injustice, of wrongdoing]; Devastation and destruction are in their highways."},{"number":8,"verse":"They do not know the way of peace, And there is no justice in their tracks. They have made them into crooked paths; Whoever walks on them does not know peace."},{"number":9,"verse":"(A Confession of Wickedness) Therefore justice is far from us, And righteousness does not overtake us. We [expectantly] hope for light, but only see darkness; We hope for gleam of light, but we walk in darkness and gloom."},{"number":10,"verse":"We grope for a wall like the blind, We grope like those who have no eyes. We stumble at midday as in the twilight; Among those who are healthy we are like dead men."},{"number":11,"verse":"We all groan and growl like bears, And coo sadly like doves; We hope for justice, but there is none, For salvation, but it is far from us."},{"number":12,"verse":"For our transgressions are multiplied before You [O LORD], And our sins testify against us; For our transgressions are with us, And we know and recognize our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing]:"},{"number":13,"verse":"Rebelling against and denying the LORD, Turning away from [following] our God, Speaking oppression and revolt, Conceiving and muttering from the heart lying words."},{"number":14,"verse":"Justice is pushed back, And righteous behavior stands far away; For truth has fallen in the city square, And integrity cannot enter."},{"number":15,"verse":"Yes, truth is missing; And he who turns away from evil makes himself a prey. Now the LORD saw it, And it displeased Him that there was no justice."},{"number":16,"verse":"He saw that there was no man, And was amazed that there was no one to intercede [on behalf of truth and right]; Therefore His own arm brought salvation to Him, And His own righteousness sustained Him."},{"number":17,"verse":"For He [the LORD] put on righteousness like a coat of armor, And salvation like a helmet on His head; He put on garments of vengeance for clothing And covered Himself with zeal [and great love for His people] as a cloak."},{"number":18,"verse":"As their deeds deserve, so He will repay: Wrath to His adversaries, retribution to His enemies; To the islands and coastlands He will repay."},{"number":19,"verse":"So they will fear the name of the LORD from the west And His glory from the rising of the sun.
