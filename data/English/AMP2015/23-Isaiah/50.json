When I called, why was there no one to answer? Is My hand really so short that it cannot redeem [My servants]? Or have I no power to rescue? Listen carefully, with My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers into a desert; Their fish stink because there is no water And die of thirst."},{"number":3,"verse":"\"I clothe the heavens with the blackness [of storm clouds] And make sackcloth [of mourning] their clothing.\""},{"number":4,"verse":"The Lord GOD has given Me [His Servant] the tongue of disciples [as One who is taught], That I may know how to sustain the weary with a word.
