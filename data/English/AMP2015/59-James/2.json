Is it not the rich who oppress and exploit you, and personally drag you into the courts of law?"},{"number":7,"verse":"Do they not blaspheme the precious name [of Christ] by which you are called?"},{"number":8,"verse":"If, however, you are [really] fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself [that is, if you have an unselfish concern for others and do things for their benefit]\" you are doing well."},{"number":9,"verse":"But if you show partiality [prejudice, favoritism], you are committing sin and are convicted by the Law as offenders."},{"number":10,"verse":"For whoever keeps the whole Law but stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of [breaking] all of it."},{"number":11,"verse":"For He who said, \"Do not commit adultery,\" also said, \"Do not murder.\" Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you have become guilty of transgressing the [entire] Law."},{"number":12,"verse":"Speak and act [consistently] as people who are going to be judged by the law of liberty [that moral law that frees obedient Christians from the bondage of sin]."},{"number":13,"verse":"For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; but [to the one who has shown mercy] mercy triumphs [victoriously] over judgment."},{"number":14,"verse":"(Faith and Works) What is the benefit, my fellow believers, if someone claims to have faith but has no [good] works [as evidence]? Can that [kind of] faith save him?
