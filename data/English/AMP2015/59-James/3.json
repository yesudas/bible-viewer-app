If anyone does not stumble in what he says [never saying the wrong thing], he is a perfect man [fully developed in character, without serious flaws], able to bridle his whole body and rein in his entire nature [taming his human faults and weaknesses]."},{"number":3,"verse":"Now if we put bits into the horses' mouths to make them obey us, we guide their whole body as well."},{"number":4,"verse":"And look at the ships. Even though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the helmsman determines."},{"number":5,"verse":"In the same sense, the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See [by comparison] how great a forest is set on fire by a small spark!"},{"number":6,"verse":"And the tongue is [in a sense] a fire, the very world of injustice and unrighteousness; the tongue is set among our members as that which contaminates the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life [the cycle of man's existence], and is itself set on fire by hell (Gehenna)."},{"number":7,"verse":"For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and sea creatures, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race."},{"number":8,"verse":"But no one can tame the human tongue; it is a restless evil [undisciplined, unstable], full of deadly poison."},{"number":9,"verse":"With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God."},{"number":10,"verse":"Out of the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. These things, my brothers, should not be this way [for we have a moral obligation to speak in a manner that reflects our fear of God and profound respect for His precepts]."},{"number":11,"verse":"Does a spring send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?"},{"number":12,"verse":"Can a fig tree, my brothers, produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh."},{"number":13,"verse":"Wisdom from AboveWho among you is wise and intelligent? Let him by his good conduct show his [good] deeds with the gentleness and humility of true wisdom."},{"number":14,"verse":"But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be arrogant, and [as a result] be in defiance of the truth."},{"number":15,"verse":"This [superficial] wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly (secular), natural (unspiritual), even demonic."},{"number":16,"verse":"For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder [unrest, rebellion] and every evil thing and morally degrading practice."},{"number":17,"verse":"But the wisdom from above is first pure [morally and spiritually undefiled], then peace-loving [courteous, considerate], gentle, reasonable [and willing to listen], full of compassion and good fruits. It is unwavering, without [self-righteous] hypocrisy [and self-serving guile]."},{"number":18,"verse":"And the seed whose fruit is righteousness (spiritual maturity) is sown in peace by those who make peace [by actively encouraging goodwill between individuals]."}]}
