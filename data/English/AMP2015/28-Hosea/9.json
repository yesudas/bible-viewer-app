You have loved prostitutes' earnings on every threshing floor [attributing the harvest to the Baals instead of to God]."},{"number":2,"verse":"The threshing floor and the wine press will no longer feed them, And the new wine will fail them [because they failed to honor the God who provides]."},{"number":3,"verse":"They will not remain in the land of the LORD, But Ephraim will return to [another] Egypt [in bondage] And they will eat [ceremonially] unclean food in Assyria."},{"number":4,"verse":"They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the LORD; Their sacrifices will not please Him. Their bread will be like mourners' bread [eaten at funerals]; All who eat it will be [ceremonially] unclean, For their bread will be for themselves; It will not enter the house of the LORD [to be consecrated]."},{"number":5,"verse":"What will you do on the day of the appointed festival And on the day of the feast of the LORD [when you are in exile]?"},{"number":6,"verse":"For behold, they will go away because of devastation and destruction; Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them. Weeds will take over their treasures of silver; Thorns will grow in their tents."},{"number":7,"verse":"The days of punishment have come; The days of retribution are at hand; Let Israel know this! The prophet is [considered] a fool; The man [of God] who is inspired is [treated as if] demented, Because of the abundance of your wickedness and guilt, And because your deep antagonism [toward God and the prophets] is so great."},{"number":8,"verse":"Ephraim was a watchman with my God, a [true] prophet [to warn the nation]; But the snare of a bird catcher was laid in all his paths. And there is only deep hostility in the house of his God (the land of Israel)."},{"number":9,"verse":"They have deeply corrupted (perverted) themselves As in the days of Gibeah. The LORD will remember their wickedness and guilt; He will punish their sins."},{"number":10,"verse":"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness [an unexpected and refreshing delight]; I saw your fathers (ancestors) as the first ripe fruit on the fig tree in its first season, But they came to Baal-peor and consecrated themselves to shamefulness [the worship of Baal], And [because of their spiritual and physical adultery] they became as detestable and loathsome as the thing they loved."},{"number":11,"verse":"As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird; No birth, no pregnancy, and [because of their impurity] no conception."},{"number":12,"verse":"Even though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them until not one is left. Indeed, woe (judgment is coming) to them when I look away and withdraw [My blessing] from them!"},{"number":13,"verse":"Ephraim, as I have seen, Is planted in a pleasant [and prosperous] meadow like Tyre; But Ephraim will bring out his children to the executioner [for slaughter]."},{"number":14,"verse":"Give them [the punishment they deserve], O LORD! What will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts."},{"number":15,"verse":"All their wickedness [says the LORD] is focused in Gilgal; Indeed, I came to hate them there! Because of the wickedness of their [idolatrous] practices I will drive them out of My house (the land of Israel)! I will love them no longer; All their princes are rebels."},{"number":16,"verse":"Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, They will bear no fruit. Even though they give birth, I will slay the precious children of their womb."},{"number":17,"verse":"My God will reject them and cast them away Because they did not listen to Him; And they will be wanderers (fugitives) among the nations."}]}
