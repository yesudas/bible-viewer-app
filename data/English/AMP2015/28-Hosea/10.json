The LORD will break down [the horns of] their altars; He will destroy their idolatrous pillars."},{"number":3,"verse":"Surely now they will say [in despair], \"We have no [true] king, For we do not revere the LORD; And as for the king, what can he do for us [to rescue us]?\""},{"number":4,"verse":"They have spoken empty (disingenuous) words, Swearing falsely to make covenants [they intend to break]; Therefore, judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field."},{"number":5,"verse":"The people of Samaria will fear and tremble For the [idolatrous] calf of Beth-aven (House of Wickedness). Indeed, its people will mourn over it And its idolatrous priests will cry out and wail over it, Over its glory, because the glory [of their calf god] has departed from it."},{"number":6,"verse":"The golden calf itself will be carried to Assyria As tribute to King Jareb; Ephraim will be seized with shame And Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel [to worship the calf and separate Israel from Judah]."},{"number":7,"verse":"As for Samaria, her king will be cut off and float away Like a twig on the surface of the water."},{"number":8,"verse":"Also the high places of Aven (Beth-aven), the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; The thorn and the thistle will grow on their [pagan] altars, And [in despair] they will say to the mountains, \"Cover us!\" And to the hills, \"Fall on us!\""},{"number":9,"verse":"O Israel, you have [willfully] sinned since the days of Gibeah; There they (Israel) stand!
