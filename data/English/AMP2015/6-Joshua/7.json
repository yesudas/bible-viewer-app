Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites."},{"number":2,"verse":"Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, \"Go up and spy out the land.\" So the men went up and spied out Ai."},{"number":3,"verse":"Then they returned to Joshua and said to him, \"Do not make all the people go up [to fight]; have only about two thousand or three thousand men go up and attack Ai; do not make the entire army go up there, for they [of Ai] are few.\""},{"number":4,"verse":"So about three thousand men from the sons of Israel went up there, but they fled [in retreat] from the men of Ai."},{"number":5,"verse":"The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of Israel's men, and chased them from the gate as far as [the bluffs of] Shebarim and struck them down as they descended [the steep pass], so the hearts of the people melted [in despair and began to doubt God's promise] and became like water (disheartened)."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and [with great sorrow] they put dust on their heads."},{"number":7,"verse":"Joshua said, \"Alas, O Lord GOD, why have You brought this people across the Jordan at all, only to hand us over to the Amorites, to destroy us?

Why is it that you have fallen on your face?"},{"number":11,"verse":"Israel has sinned; they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them [to keep]. They have even taken some of the things under the ban, and they have both stolen and denied [the theft]. Moreover, they have also put the stolen objects among their own things."},{"number":12,"verse":"That is why the soldiers of Israel could not stand [and defend themselves] before their enemies; they turned their backs [and ran] before them, because they have become accursed. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the things under the ban from among you."},{"number":13,"verse":"Rise up! Consecrate the people and say, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: \"There are things under the ban among you, O Israel.
