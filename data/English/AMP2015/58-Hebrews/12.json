God is dealing with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?"},{"number":8,"verse":"Now if you are exempt from correction and without discipline, in which all [of God's children] share, then you are illegitimate children and not sons [at all]."},{"number":9,"verse":"Moreover, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we submitted and respected them [for training us]; shall we not much more willingly submit to the Father of spirits, and live [by learning from His discipline]?"},{"number":10,"verse":"For our earthly fathers disciplined us for only a short time as seemed best to them; but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness."},{"number":11,"verse":"For the time being no discipline brings joy, but seems sad and painful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness [right standing with God and a lifestyle and attitude that seeks conformity to God's will and purpose]."},{"number":12,"verse":"So then, strengthen hands that are weak and knees that tremble."},{"number":13,"verse":"Cut through and make smooth, straight paths for your feet [that are safe and go in the right direction], so that the leg which is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather may be healed."},{"number":14,"verse":"Continually pursue peace with everyone, and the sanctification without which no one will [ever] see the Lord."},{"number":15,"verse":"See to it that no one falls short of God's grace; that no root of resentment springs up and causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;"},{"number":16,"verse":"and [see to it] that no one is immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal."},{"number":17,"verse":"For you know that later on, when he wanted [to regain title to] his inheritance of the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no opportunity for repentance [there was no way to repair what he had done, no chance to recall the choice he had made], even though he sought for it with [bitter] tears."},{"number":18,"verse":"Contrast of Sinai and ZionFor you have not come [as did the Israelites in the wilderness] to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire, and to gloom and darkness and a raging windstorm,"},{"number":19,"verse":"and to the blast of a trumpet and a sound of words [such that] those who heard it begged that nothing more be said to them."},{"number":20,"verse":"For they could not bear the command, \"If even a wild animal touches the mountain, it will be stoned [to death].\""},{"number":21,"verse":"In fact, so terrifying was the sight, that Moses said, \"I am filled with fear and trembling.\""},{"number":22,"verse":"But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels [in festive gathering],"},{"number":23,"verse":"and to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are registered [as citizens] in heaven, and to God, who is Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous (the redeemed in heaven) who have been made perfect [bringing them to their final glory],"},{"number":24,"verse":"and to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant [uniting God and man], and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks [of mercy], a better and nobler and more gracious message than the blood of Abel [which cried out for vengeance]."},{"number":25,"verse":"The Unshaken KingdomSee to it that you do not refuse [to listen to] Him who is speaking [to you now]. For if those [sons of Israel] did not escape when they refused [to listen to] him who warned them on earth [revealing God's will], how much less will we escape if we turn our backs on Him who warns from heaven?"},{"number":26,"verse":"His voice shook the earth [at Mount Sinai] then, but now He has given a promise, saying, \"Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the [starry] heaven.\""},{"number":27,"verse":"Now this [expression], \"Yet once more,\" indicates the removal and final transformation of all those things which can be shaken-that is, of that which has been created-so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain."},{"number":28,"verse":"Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, and offer to God pleasing service and acceptable worship with reverence and awe;"},{"number":29,"verse":"for our God is [indeed] a consuming fire."}]}
