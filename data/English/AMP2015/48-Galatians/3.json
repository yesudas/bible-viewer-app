{"bibleAbbr":"AMP2015","bookName":"Galatians","bookEnglishName":"Galatians","chapterNumber":3,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"Faith Brings Righteousness O you foolish and thoughtless and superficial Galatians, who has bewitched you [that you would act like this], to whom-right before your very eyes-Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified [in the gospel message]?"},{"number":2,"verse":"This is all I want to ask of you: did you receive the [Holy] Spirit as the result of obeying [the requirements of] the Law, or was it the result of hearing [the message of salvation and] with faith [believing it]?"},{"number":3,"verse":"Are you so foolish and senseless? Having begun [your new life by faith] with the Spirit, are you now being perfected and reaching spiritual maturity by the flesh [that is, by your own works and efforts to keep the Law]?"},{"number":4,"verse":"Have you suffered so many things and experienced so much all for nothing-if indeed it was all for nothing?"},{"number":5,"verse":"So then, does He who supplies you with His [marvelous Holy] Spirit and works miracles among you, do it as a result of the works of the Law [which you perform], or because you [believe confidently in the message which you] heard with faith?"},{"number":6,"verse":"Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness, [as conformity to God's will and purpose-so it is with you also]."},{"number":7,"verse":"So understand that it is the people who live by faith [with confidence in the power and goodness of God] who are [the true] sons of Abraham."},{"number":8,"verse":"The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the good news [of the Savior] to Abraham in advance [with this promise], saying, \"In you shall all the nations be blessed.\""},{"number":9,"verse":"So then those who are people of faith [whether Jew or Gentile] are blessed and favored by God [and declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty, and placed in right standing with Him] along with Abraham, the believer."},{"number":10,"verse":"For all who depend on the Law [seeking justification and salvation by obedience to the Law and the observance of rituals] are under a curse; for it is written, \"Cursed (condemned to destruction) is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, so as to practice them.\""},{"number":11,"verse":"Now it is clear that no one is justified [that is, declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty, and placed in right standing] before God by the Law, for \"The righteous (the just, the upright) shall live by faith.\""},{"number":12,"verse":"But the Law does not rest on or require faith [it has nothing to do with faith], but [instead, the Law] says, \"He who practices them [the things prescribed by the Law] shall live by them [instead of faith].\""},{"number":13,"verse":"Christ purchased our freedom and redeemed us from the curse of the Law and its condemnation by becoming a curse for us-for it is written, \"Cursed is everyone who hangs [crucified] on a tree (cross)\"-"},{"number":14,"verse":"in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might also come to the Gentiles, so that we would all receive [the realization of] the promise of the [Holy] Spirit through faith."},{"number":15,"verse":"Intent of the LawBrothers and sisters, I speak in terms of human relations: even though a last will and testament is just a human covenant, yet when it has been signed and made legally binding, no one sets it aside or adds to it [modifying it in some way]."},{"number":16,"verse":"Now the promises [in the covenants] were decreed to Abraham and to his seed. God does not say, \"And to seeds (descendants, heirs),\" as if [referring] to many [persons], but as to one, \"And to your Seed,\" who is [none other than] Christ."},{"number":17,"verse":"This is what I mean: the Law, which came into existence four hundred and thirty years later [after the covenant concerning the coming Messiah], does not and cannot invalidate the covenant previously established by God, so as to abolish the promise."},{"number":18,"verse":"For if the inheritance [of what was promised] is based on [observing] the Law [as these false teachers claim], it is no longer based on a promise; however, God granted it to Abraham [as a gift] by virtue of His promise."},{"number":19,"verse":"Why, then, the Law [what was its purpose]? It was added [after the promise to Abraham, to reveal to people their guilt] because of transgressions [that is, to make people conscious of the sinfulness of sin], and [the Law] was ordained through angels and delivered to Israel by the hand of a mediator [Moses, the mediator between God and Israel, to be in effect] until the Seed would come to whom the promise had been made."},{"number":20,"verse":"Now the mediator or go-between [in a transaction] is not [needed] for just one party; whereas God is only one [and was the only One giving the promise to Abraham, but the Law was a contract between two, God and Israel; its validity depended on both]."},{"number":21,"verse":"Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a system of law had been given which could impart life, then righteousness (right standing with God) would actually have been based on law."},{"number":22,"verse":"But the Scripture has imprisoned everyone [everything-the entire world] under sin, so that [the inheritance, the blessing of salvation] which was promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe [in Him and acknowledge Him as God's precious Son]."},{"number":23,"verse":"Now before faith came, we were kept in custody under the Law, [perpetually] imprisoned [in preparation] for the faith that was destined to be revealed,"},{"number":24,"verse":"with the result that the Law has become our tutor and our disciplinarian to guide us to Christ, so that we may be justified [that is, declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty, and placed in right standing with God] by faith."},{"number":25,"verse":"But now that faith has come, we are no longer under [the control and authority of] a tutor and disciplinarian."},{"number":26,"verse":"For you [who are born-again have been reborn from above-spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified and] are all children of God [set apart for His purpose with full rights and privileges] through faith in Christ Jesus."},{"number":27,"verse":"For all of you who were baptized into Christ [into a spiritual union with the Christ, the Anointed] have clothed yourselves with Christ [that is, you have taken on His characteristics and values]."},{"number":28,"verse":"There is [now no distinction in regard to salvation] neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you [who believe] are all one in Christ Jesus [no one can claim a spiritual superiority]."},{"number":29,"verse":"And if you belong to Christ [if you are in Him], then you are Abraham's descendants, and [spiritual] heirs according to [God's] promise."}]}
