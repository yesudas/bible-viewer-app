{"bibleAbbr":"AMP2015","bookName":"Romans","bookEnglishName":"Romans","chapterNumber":14,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"Principles of Conscience As for the one whose faith is weak, accept him [into your fellowship], but not for [the purpose of] quarreling over his opinions."},{"number":2,"verse":"One man's faith permits him to eat everything, while the weak believer eats only vegetables [to avoid eating ritually unclean meat or something previously considered unclean]."},{"number":3,"verse":"The one who eats [everything] is not to look down on the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat must not criticize or pass judgment on the one who eats [everything], for God has accepted him."},{"number":4,"verse":"Who are you to judge the servant of another? Before his own master he stands [approved] or falls [out of favor]. And he [who serves the Master-the Lord] will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand."},{"number":5,"verse":"One person regards one day as better [or more important] than another, while another regards every day [the same as any other]. Let everyone be fully convinced (assured, satisfied) in his own mind."},{"number":6,"verse":"He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord. He who eats, eats for the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; while he who abstains, abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God."},{"number":7,"verse":"None of us lives for himself [for his own benefit, but for the Lord], and none of us dies for himself [but for the Lord]."},{"number":8,"verse":"If we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. So then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's."},{"number":9,"verse":"For Christ died and lived again for this reason, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living."},{"number":10,"verse":"But you, why do you criticize your brother? Or you again, why do you look down on your [believing] brother or regard him with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God [who alone is judge]."},{"number":11,"verse":"For it is written [in Scripture], \"As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, And every tongue shall give praise to God.\""},{"number":12,"verse":"So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God."},{"number":13,"verse":"Then let us not criticize one another anymore, but rather determine this-not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block or a source of temptation in another believer's way."},{"number":14,"verse":"I know and am convinced [as one] in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean [ritually defiled, and unholy] in itself; but [nonetheless] it is unclean to anyone who thinks it is unclean."},{"number":15,"verse":"If your brother is being hurt or offended because of food [that you insist on eating], you are no longer walking in love [toward him]. Do not let what you eat destroy and spiritually harm one for whom Christ died."},{"number":16,"verse":"Therefore do not let what is a good thing for you [because of your freedom to choose] be spoken of as evil [by someone else];"},{"number":17,"verse":"for the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking [what one likes], but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."},{"number":18,"verse":"For the one who serves Christ in this way [recognizing that food choice is secondary] is acceptable to God and is approved by men."},{"number":19,"verse":"So then, let us pursue [with enthusiasm] the things which make for peace and the building up of one another [things which lead to spiritual growth]."},{"number":20,"verse":"Do not, for the sake of food, tear down the work of God. All things indeed are [ceremonially] clean, but they are wrong for the person who eats and offends [another's conscience in the process]."},{"number":21,"verse":"It is good [to do the right thing and] not eat meat or drink wine, or do anything that offends your brother and weakens him spiritually."},{"number":22,"verse":"The faith which you have [that gives you freedom of choice], have as your own conviction before God [just keep it between yourself and God, seeking His will]. Happy is he who has no reason to condemn himself for what he approves."},{"number":23,"verse":"But he who is uncertain [about eating a particular thing] is condemned if he eats, because he is not acting from faith. Whatever is not from faith is sin [whatever is done with doubt is sinful]."}]}
