Or what is the benefit of circumcision?"},{"number":2,"verse":"Great in every respect. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God [His very words]."},{"number":3,"verse":"What then? If some did not believe or were unfaithful [to God], their lack of belief will not nullify and make invalid the faithfulness of God and His word, will it?"},{"number":4,"verse":"Certainly not! Let God be found true [as He will be], though every person be found a liar, just as it is written [in Scripture], \"That You may be justified in Your words, And prevail when You are judged [by sinful men].\""},{"number":5,"verse":"But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God is not wrong to inflict His wrath [on us], is He? (I am speaking in purely human terms.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"Certainly not! For otherwise, how will God judge the world?"},{"number":7,"verse":"But [as you might say] if through my lie God's truth was magnified and abounded to His glory, why am I still being judged as a sinner?"},{"number":8,"verse":"And why not say, (as some slanderously report and claim that we teach) \"Let us do evil so that good may come of it\"? Their condemnation [by God] is just."},{"number":9,"verse":"Well then, are we [Jews] better off than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles) are under the control of sin and subject to its power."},{"number":10,"verse":"As it is written and forever remains written, \"There is none righteous [none that meets God's standard], not even one."},{"number":11,"verse":"\"There is none who understands, There is none who seeks for God."},{"number":12,"verse":"\"All have turned aside, together they have become useless; There is none who does good, no, not one.\""},{"number":13,"verse":"\"Their throat is an open grave; They [habitually] deceive with their tongues.\" \"The venom of asps is beneath their lips.\""},{"number":14,"verse":"\"Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.\""},{"number":15,"verse":"\"Their feet are swift to shed blood,"},{"number":16,"verse":"Destruction and misery are in their paths,"},{"number":17,"verse":"And they have not known the path of peace.\""},{"number":18,"verse":"\"There is no fear of God [and His awesome power] before their eyes.\""},{"number":19,"verse":"Now we know that whatever the Law [of Moses] says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that [the excuses of] every mouth may be silenced [from protesting] and that all the world may be held accountable to God [and subject to His judgment]."},{"number":20,"verse":"For no person will be justified [freed of guilt and declared righteous] in His sight by [trying to do] the works of the Law. For through the Law we become conscious of sin [and the recognition of sin directs us toward repentance, but provides no remedy for sin]."},{"number":21,"verse":"Justification by FaithBut now the righteousness of God has been clearly revealed [independently and completely] apart from the Law, though it is [actually] confirmed by the Law and the [words and writings of the] Prophets."},{"number":22,"verse":"This righteousness of God comes through faith in Jesus Christ for all those [Jew or Gentile] who believe [and trust in Him and acknowledge Him as God's Son].

This was to demonstrate His righteousness [which demands punishment for sin], because in His forbearance [His deliberate restraint] He passed over the sins previously committed [before Jesus' crucifixion]."},{"number":26,"verse":"It was to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the One who justifies those who have faith in Jesus [and rely confidently on Him as Savior]."},{"number":27,"verse":"Then what becomes of [our] boasting? It is excluded [entirely ruled out, banished]. On what principle? On [the principle of good] works? No, but on the principle of faith."},{"number":28,"verse":"For we maintain that an individual is justified by faith distinctly apart from works of the Law [the observance of which has nothing to do with justification, that is, being declared free of the guilt of sin and made acceptable to God]."},{"number":29,"verse":"Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not also the God of Gentiles [who were not given the Law]? Yes, of Gentiles also,"},{"number":30,"verse":"since indeed it is one [and the same] God who will justify the circumcised by faith [which began with Abraham] and the uncircumcised through [their newly acquired] faith."},{"number":31,"verse":"Do we then nullify the Law by this faith [making the Law of no effect, overthrowing it]? Certainly not! On the contrary, we confirm and establish and uphold the Law [since it convicts us all of sin, pointing to the need for salvation]."}]}
