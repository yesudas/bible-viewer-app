And behold I saw the tears of the oppressed and they had no one to comfort them; and on the side of their oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort them."},{"number":2,"verse":"So I congratulated and thought more fortunate are those who are already dead than the living who are still living."},{"number":3,"verse":"But better off than either of them is the one who has not yet been born, who has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun."},{"number":4,"verse":"I have seen that every [effort in] labor and every skill in work comes from man's rivalry with his neighbor. This too is vanity (futility, false pride) and chasing after the wind."},{"number":5,"verse":"The fool folds his hands [together] and consumes his own flesh [destroying himself by idleness and apathy]."},{"number":6,"verse":"One hand full of rest and patience is better than two fists full of labor and chasing after the wind."},{"number":7,"verse":"Then I looked again at vanity under the sun [in one of its peculiar forms]."},{"number":8,"verse":"There was a certain man-without a dependent, having neither a child nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches and he never asked, \"For whom do I labor and deprive myself of pleasure?\" This too is vanity (a wisp of smoke, self-conceit); yes, it is a painful effort and an unhappy task."},{"number":9,"verse":"Two are better than one because they have a more satisfying return for their labor;"},{"number":10,"verse":"for if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion.
