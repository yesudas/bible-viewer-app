I do not judge anyone."},{"number":16,"verse":"But even if I do judge, My judgment is true and My decision is right; for I am not alone [in making it], but I and the Father who sent Me [make the same judgment]."},{"number":17,"verse":"Even in your own law it is written that the testimony of two persons is true [valid and admissible]."},{"number":18,"verse":"I am One [of the Two] who testifies about Myself, and My Father who sent Me testifies about Me.\""},{"number":19,"verse":"Then the Pharisees said to Him, \"Where is this Father of Yours?\" Jesus answered, \"You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also.\""},{"number":20,"verse":"Jesus said these things in the treasury, as He taught in the temple [courtyard]; and no one seized Him, because His time had not yet come."},{"number":21,"verse":"Then He said again to them, \"I am going away, and you will look for Me, and you will die [unforgiven and condemned] in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.\""},{"number":22,"verse":"So the Jews were asking [among themselves], \"Will He kill Himself?

For I have not even come on My own initiative [as self-appointed], but He [is the One who] sent Me."},{"number":43,"verse":"Why do you misunderstand what I am saying? It is because [your spiritual ears are deaf and] you are unable to hear [the truth of] My word."},{"number":44,"verse":"You are of your father the devil, and it is your will to practice the desires [which are characteristic] of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks what it natural to him, for he is a liar and the father of lies and half-truths."},{"number":45,"verse":"But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me [and continue in your unbelief]."},{"number":46,"verse":"Which one of you [has proof and] convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?"},{"number":47,"verse":"Whoever is of God and belongs to Him hears [the truth of] God's words; for this reason you do not hear them: because you are not of God and you are not in fellowship with Him.\""},{"number":48,"verse":"The Jews answered Him, \"Are we not right when we say You are a Samaritan and [that You] have a demon [and are under its power]?\""},{"number":49,"verse":"Jesus answered, \"I do not have a demon.

Abraham died, and also the prophets; yet You say, 'If anyone keeps My word, he will never, ever taste of death.'"},{"number":53,"verse":"Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too! Whom do You make Yourself out to be?\""},{"number":54,"verse":"Jesus answered, \"If I glorify Myself, My glory is [worth] nothing. It is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, 'He is our God.'"},{"number":55,"verse":"Yet you do not know Him, but I know Him fully. If I said I did not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know Him and keep His word."},{"number":56,"verse":"Your father Abraham [greatly] rejoiced to see My day (My incarnation). He saw it and was delighted.\""},{"number":57,"verse":"Then the Jews said to Him, \"You are not even fifty years old, and You [claim to] have seen Abraham?\""},{"number":58,"verse":"Jesus replied, \"I assure you and most solemnly say to you, before Abraham was born, I Am.\""},{"number":59,"verse":"So they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus concealed Himself and left the temple."}]}
