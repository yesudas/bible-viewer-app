A sower went out to sow seed;"},{"number":4,"verse":"and as he was sowing, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and ate it up."},{"number":5,"verse":"Other seed fell on rocks where there was not much soil; and immediately a plant sprang up because the soil had no depth."},{"number":6,"verse":"And when the sun came up, the plant was scorched; and because it had no root, it dried up and withered away."},{"number":7,"verse":"Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no grain."},{"number":8,"verse":"And other seed fell into good soil, and as the plants grew and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundred times [as much as had been sown].\""},{"number":9,"verse":"And He said, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear and heed My words.\""},{"number":10,"verse":"As soon as He was alone, those who were around Him, together with the twelve [disciples], began asking Him about [the interpretation of] the parables."},{"number":11,"verse":"He said to them, \"The mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you [who have teachable hearts], but those who are outside [the unbelievers, the spiritually blind] get everything in parables,"},{"number":12,"verse":"so that they will continually look but not see, and they will continually hear but not understand, otherwise they might turn [from their rejection of the truth] and be forgiven.\""},{"number":13,"verse":"ExplanationThen He said to them, \"Do you not understand this parable?
