According as he hath chosen us in To be adopted in him. him before the foundation of the world, He expounds the next final cause which is twofold, that is, sanctification and justification, of which he will speak later. And by this also two things are to be noted, that is, that holiness of life cannot be separated from the grace of election: and again, whatever pureness is in us, is the gift of God who has freely of his mercy chosen us. that we God then, did not choose us because we were, or otherwise would have been holy, but to the end we should be holy. should Being clothed with Christ's righteousness. be holy and without blame Truly and sincerely. before him in love:"},{"number":5,"verse":"Another plainer exposition of the efficient cause, and also of eternal election, by which God is said to have chosen us in Christ, that is, because it pleased him to appoint us when we were not yet born, whom he would make to be his children by Jesus Christ.
