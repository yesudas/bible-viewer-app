And yet nonetheless when they gave themselves to idol's feasts, they perished in the wilderness, being horribly and manifoldly punished. Now, moreover and besides that these things are fitly spoken against those who frequented idol's feasts, the same also seems to be alleged to this end and purpose, because many men think that those things are not of such great weight that God will be angry with them if they use them. And so they frequent Christian assemblies and are baptized, and receive the communion, and confess Christ. brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our Paul says this in respect of the covenant, and not in respect of the persons, except generally. fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"},{"number":2,"verse":"In effect the ordinances of the old fathers were all one with ours, for they respected Christ alone, who offered himself to them in different forms.

For this is the beginning of all evil, as of idolatry (which has gluttony as a companion), fornication, rebelling against Christ, murmuring, and such like. And these things God punished most sharply in that old people, to the end that we who succeed them, and have a more full declaration of the will of God, might by that means take better heed. Now these things were our Some read «figures»: which signified our ordinances.

He gives the following line of reasoning. The holy banquets of the Christians are pledges, first of all, of the community that they have with Christ, and next, one with another. The Israelites also do ratify in the sacrifices, their mutual union in the very same religion. Therefore so do the idolaters also join themselves with their idols, or demons rather (for idols are nothing) in those solemn banquets, whereupon it follows, that that table is a table of demons, and therefore you must avoid it. For you cannot be partakers of the Lord and of idols together, much less may such banquets be considered as indifferent things. Will you then strive with God? And if you do, do you think that you will get the upper hand? I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say."},{"number":16,"verse":"The cup of Of thanksgiving: whereupon, that holy banquet was called «eucharist», which is Greek for thanksgiving. blessing which we bless, is it not the A most effectual pledge and note of your joining together with Christ, and ingrafting to him. communion of the blood of Christ?

And therefore there are many things which of themselves are lawful, which may be evil when done by us, because of offence to our neighbour. See before in (1Co_6:13).

And this is through our fault, if we choose rather to offend the conscience of the weak, than to yield a little of our liberty in a matter of no importance, and so give occasion to the weak to judge in such sort of us, and of Christian liberty.
