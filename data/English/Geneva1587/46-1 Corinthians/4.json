Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."},{"number":3,"verse":"In reprehending others, he sets himself for an example, and anticipates an objection. Using the gravity of an apostle, he shows that he does not care for the contrary judgments that those have of him, in that they esteemed him as a vile person, because he did not set forth himself as they did. And he brings good reasons why he was not moved with the judgments which they had of him. But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, First, because that which men judge in these cases of their own brains is not to be considered any more than when the unlearned judge of wisdom. or of man's Literally, «day», after the manner of Cilician speech. judgment: yea, Secondly, he says, how can you judge how much or how little I am to be made responsible for, seeing that I myself who know myself better than you do, and who dare profess that I have walked in my calling with a good conscience, dare not yet nonetheless claim anything to myself. Nonetheless, I know that I am not blameless: much less therefore should I flatter myself as you do. I judge not mine own self."},{"number":4,"verse":"For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the I submit myself to the Lord's judgment.

Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have One could not be praised above the rest, without the others being blamed: and he mentions praise rather than lack of praise, because the beginning of this dispute was this, that they gave more to some men than was appropriate. praise of God."},{"number":6,"verse":"Having rejected their judgment, he sets forth himself again as a singular example of modesty, as one who concealed in this epistle those factious teacher's names, did not hesitate to put down his own name and Apollos' in their place, and took upon him as it were their shame. And this shows how far was he from preferring himself to any. And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and [to] Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn By our example, who choose rather to take other men's faults upon us, than to find fault with any by name. in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another."},{"number":7,"verse":"He shows a good way to bridle pride. First, if you consider how it is wrong for you to exclude yourself from the number of others, seeing you are a man yourself. Second, if you consider that even though you have something more than other men have, yet you only have it by God's bountifulness. And what wise man is he that will brag of another's goodness, and that against God? For who maketh thee to differ [from another]? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive [it], why dost thou glory, as if There is nothing then in us by nature that is worthy of commendation: but all that we have, we have it of grace, which the Pelegians and semi-Pelegians will not confess. thou hadst not received [it]?"},{"number":8,"verse":"He descends to a most grave mockery, to cause those glory-seeking men to blush, even though they did not want to.
