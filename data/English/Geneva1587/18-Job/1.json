Uz, whose name [was] Job; and that man was perfect and Since he was a Gentile and not a Jew and yet is pronounced upright and without hypocrisy, it declares that among the heathen God revealed himself. upright, and By this it is declared what is meant by an upright and just man. one that feared God, and eschewed evil. The Argument - In this history the example of patience is set before our eyes. This holy man Job was not only extremely afflicted in outward things and in his body, but also in his mind and conscience, by the sharp temptation of his wife and friends: who by their vehement words and subtle disputations brought him almost to despair. They set forth God as a sincere judge, and mortal enemy to him who had cast him off, therefore in vain he should seek him for help. These friends came to him under pretence of consolation, and yet they tormented him more than all his afflictions did. Even so, he constantly resisted them, and eventually succeeded. In this story we must note that Job maintains a good cause, but handles it badly. His adversaries have an evil matter, but they defend it craftily. Job held that God did not always punish men according to their sins, but that he had secret judgments, of which man knew not the cause, and therefore man could not reason against God in it, but he should be convicted. Moreover, he was assured that God had not rejected him, yet through his great torments and afflictions he speaks many inconveniences and shows himself as a desperate man in many things, and as one that would resist God, and this is his good cause which he handles well. Again the adversaries maintain with many good arguments that God punishes continually according to the trespass, grounding on God's providence, his justice and man's sins, yet their intention is evil; for they labour to bring Job into despair, and so they maintain an evil cause. Ezekiel commends Job as a just man, (Eze_14:14) and James sets out his patience for an example, (Jam_5:11)."},{"number":2,"verse":"And he had seue sonnes, & three daughters."},{"number":3,"verse":"His His children and riches are declared, to commend his virtue in his prosperity and his patience and constancy when God took them from him. substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of Meaning, the Arabians, Chaldeans, Idumeans etc. the east."},{"number":4,"verse":"And his sonnes went & banketted in their houses, euery one his day, and sent, & called their three sisters to eate and to drinke with them."},{"number":5,"verse":"And it was so, when the days of [their] feasting were gone about, that Job sent and That is, commanded them to be sanctified: meaning, that they should consider the faults that they had committed, and reconcile themselves for the same. sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and That is, he offered for each of his children an offering of reconciliation, which declared his religion toward God, and the care that he had for his children. offered burnt offerings [according] to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and In Hebrew it is, «blessed God», which is sometimes taken for blaspheming and cursing, as it is here and in (1Ki_21:10, 1Ki_21:13). cursed God in their hearts.
