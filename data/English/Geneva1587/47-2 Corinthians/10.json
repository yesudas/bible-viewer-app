And he reviles certain proud men who made no better account of him, than of a bragging proud man, in that he used to be sharp against them when he was absent, because they saw no great majesty in him after the manner of men; and besides, he had proved his gentleness, even though in his absence he had written to them sharply. Therefore first of all he professes that he was gentle and moderate, but after the example of Christ: but if they continue still to despise his gentleness, he protests to them that he will show indeed how far they are deceived, who judge the office of an apostle in the same way that they judge worldly offices, that is, according to the outward appearance. I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and That nature which is inclined to mercy, rather than to rigor of justice. gentleness of Christ, who in presence [am] base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:"},{"number":2,"verse":"But I beseech [you], that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked As though I had no other aid and help than that which outwardly I seem to have: and therefore Paul contrasts his flesh, that is, his weak condition and state, with his spiritual and apostolic dignity. according to the flesh."},{"number":3,"verse":"Secondly, he witnesses that although he is similar to other men, yet he comes furnished with that strength which no defence of man can match, whether they resist by craft and deceit, or by force and might, because he battles with divine weapons. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:"},{"number":4,"verse":"(For the weapons of our warfare [are] not Are not those weapons that men get authority over one another with, and do great acts. carnal, but mighty through Stand upon the foundation of God's infinite power.

Do ye look on things after the Do you judge things according to the outward appearance? outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of Not being told about it by me. himself think this again, that, as he [is] Christ's, even so [are] we Christ's."},{"number":8,"verse":"For though I shoulde boast somewhat more of our authoritie, which the Lorde hath giuen vs for edification, and not for your destruction, I should haue no shame."},{"number":9,"verse":"This I say, that I may not seeme as it were to feare you with letters."},{"number":10,"verse":"For [his] letters, say He notes out those who were the cause of these words. they, [are] weighty and powerful; but [his] bodily presence [is] weak, and [his] speech contemptible."},{"number":11,"verse":"Let such one thinke this, that such as wee are in woorde by letters, when we are absent, such wil we be also in deede, when we are present."},{"number":12,"verse":"Being forced to refute the foolish braggings of certain ambitious men, he witnesses that they are able to bring nothing, but that they falsely think highly of themselves. And as for himself, although he brags of excellent things, yet he will not pass the bounds which God has measured him out. And according to these bounds he came even to them in preaching the Gospel of Christ, and trusts that he will go further, when they have so profited that he will not need to remain any longer among them to instruct them. And to this is added an amplification, in that he never followed the labours of other men. For we This is spoken in a taunting manner. dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by Upon a vain persuasion that they have of themselves, they attribute to themselves anything at all. themselves, and They condemn others, and measure all their doings only by themselves. comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."},{"number":13,"verse":"But we will not boast of things without [our] Of those things which God has not measured to me. measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you."},{"number":14,"verse":"For we stretche not our selues beyonde our measure, as though wee had not attained vnto you: for euen to you also haue we come in preaching the Gospel of Christ,"},{"number":15,"verse":"Not boasting of things As though God had divided the whole world among the apostles to be governed. without [our] measure, [that is], of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,"},{"number":16,"verse":"To preach the gospel in the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in In countries which other men have prepared and cultivated with the preaching of the Gospel. another man's line of things made ready to our hand."},{"number":17,"verse":"He somewhat moderates that which he spoke of himself, and in so doing also prepares the Corinthians to hear other things, witnessing that he seeks nothing else but to approve himself to God, whose glory alone he seeks. But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."},{"number":18,"verse":"For hee that praiseth himselfe, is not alowed, but he whome the Lorde praiseth."}]}
