For, he says, the Law (that is, the whole government of God's house according to the Law) was as it were a tutor or overseer appointed for a time. And when that protection and overseeing which was but for a time is ended, we would at length come to be at our own liberty, and would live as children, and not as servants. Moreover, he shows along the way, that the governance of the Law was as it were the basics, and as certain principles, in comparison with the doctrine of the Gospel.

And moreover, that we are not sons by nature, but by adoption, and that in the Son of God, who therefore took upon him our flesh, that we might be made his brethren. But when the The time is said to be full when all parts of it are past and ended, and therefore Christ could not have come either sooner or later. fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a He calls Mary a woman in respect of the sex, and not as the word is used in a contrary sense to a virgin, for she remained a virgin still. woman, made under the law,"},{"number":5,"verse":"To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the The adoption of the sons of God is from everlasting, but is revealed and shown in the time appointed for it. adoption of sons."},{"number":6,"verse":"He shows that we are free and set at liberty in such a way that in the meantime we must be governed by the Spirit of Christ, who while reigning in our hearts, may teach us the true service of the Father. But this is not to serve, but rather to enjoy true liberty, as it is fitting for sons and heirs. And because ye are sons, God hath By that which follows he gathers that which went before: for if we have his Spirit, we are his sons, and if we are his sons, then we are free. sent forth the The Holy Spirit, who is both of the Father, and of the Son. But there is a special reason why he is called the Spirit of the Son, that is, because the Holy Spirit seals up our adoption in Christ, and gives us a full assurance of it.

But seeing that the Galatians were taken and called out of idolatry to Christian liberty, what pretence might they have to go back to those impotent and beggarly elements? Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods."},{"number":9,"verse":"But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and They are called impotent and beggarly ceremonies, being considered apart by themselves without Christ: and again, by that means they gave good testimony that they were beggars in Christ, for when men fall back from Christ to ceremonies, it is nothing else but to cast away riches and to follow beggary. beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire By going backward. again to be in bondage?"},{"number":10,"verse":"Ye obserue dayes, and moneths, and times and yeeres."},{"number":11,"verse":"I am in feare of you, lest I haue bestowed on you labour in vaine."},{"number":12,"verse":"He moderates and qualifies those things in which he might have seemed to have spoken somewhat sharply, very skilfully and divinely declaring his good will toward them in such a way, that the Galatians could not but either be utterly hopeless when they read these things, or acknowledge their own lack of steadfastness with tears, and desire pardon. Brethren, I beseech you, be as I [am]; for I [am] as ye [are]: ye have not injured me at all."},{"number":13,"verse":"Ye know how through Many afflictions. infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first."},{"number":14,"verse":"And my Those daily troubles with which the Lord tried me among you. temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, [even] as For the sake of my ministry.

Therefore the apostle, after various arguments with which he has refuted their error, brings forth an allegory, in which he says that the Holy Spirit did through symbolism let us know all these mysteries: that is, that it should come to pass that two sorts of sons should have Abraham as a father common to them both, but not with equal success. For as Abraham begat Ishmael by the common course of nature, of Hagar his bondmaid and a stranger, and begat Isaac of Sara a free woman, by the virtue of the promise, and by grace only, the first was not heir, and also persecuted the heir. So there are two covenants, and as it were two sons born to Abraham by those two covenants, as it were by two mothers. The one was made in Sinai, outside of the land of promise, according to which covenant Abraham's children according to the flesh were begotten: that is, the Jews, who seek righteousness by that covenant, that is, by the Law. But they are not heirs, and they will at length be cast out of the house, as those that persecute the true heirs. The other was made in that high Jerusalem, or in Zion (that is, by the sacrifice of Christ) which begets children of promise, that is, believers, by the power of the Holy Spirit. And these children (like Abraham) do rest themselves in the free promise, and they alone by the right of children will be partakers of the father's inheritance, whereas those servants will be shut out.

For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the She that is destroyed and laid waste. desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband."},{"number":28,"verse":"Now we, brethren, After the manner of Isaac, who is the first begotten of the heavenly Jerusalem, as Israel is of the slavish synagogue. as Isaac was, are the children of That seed to which the promise belongs. promise."},{"number":29,"verse":"But as then he that was born after the By the common course of nature. flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the By the virtue of God's promise and after a spiritual manner.

So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."}]}
