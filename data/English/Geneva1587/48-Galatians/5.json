Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be Circumcision is in other places called the seal of righteousness, but here we must have consideration of the circumstance of the time, for now baptism is a sign of the new covenant, just as circumcision was the sign of the old covenant. And moreover Paul reasons according to the opinion that his enemies had of it, which made circumcision a essential to their salvation. circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."},{"number":3,"verse":"For I testifie againe to euery man, which is circumcised, that he is bound to keepe the whole Lawe."},{"number":4,"verse":"Christ is That is, as he himself expounds it afterward, «ye are fallen from grace.» become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are That is, seek to be justified by the Law, for indeed no man is justified by the Law. justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace."},{"number":5,"verse":"He privately compares the new people with the old: for it is certain that they also did ground all their hope of justification and life in faith, and not in circumcision, but in such a way that their faith was wrapped in the external and ceremonial worship. But our faith is without such ceremony, and content with spiritual worship. For we through the Through the Spirit who brings about faith.

For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor He makes mention also of uncircumcision, lest the Gentiles should please themselves in it, as the Jews do in circumcision. uncircumcision; The taking away of an objection: if all that worship of the Law is taken away, in what than shall we exercise ourselves?
