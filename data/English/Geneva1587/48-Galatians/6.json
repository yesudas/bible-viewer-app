Therefore every one must seek to have praise of his own life by approving himself, and not by rebuking others. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the Christ, in plain and clear words, calls the commandment of charity his commandment. law of Christ."},{"number":3,"verse":"For if any man seeme to himselfe, that he is somewhat, when he is nothing, hee deceiueth himselfe in his imagination."},{"number":4,"verse":"But let euery man prooue his owne worke: and then shal he haue reioycing in himselfe onely and not in another."},{"number":5,"verse":"A reason why men ought to carefully watch themselves not others, because every man will be judged before God according to his own life, and not by comparing himself with other men.

Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in Of whatever he has according to his ability. all good things."},{"number":7,"verse":"He commends liberality towards the poor, and first of all chides those who were not ashamed to pretend this and that, and all because they would not help their neighbours, as though they could deceive God. And afterward he compares alms to a spiritual sowing which will have a most plentiful harvest, so that it will be very profitable: and compares being a covetous miser to sowing carnally, from which nothing can be gathered but such things as fade away, and eventually perish. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."},{"number":8,"verse":"For he that soweth to his To the commodities of this present life. flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting."},{"number":9,"verse":"Against those who are generous at the beginning, but do not continue, because the harvest seems to be deferred a long time, as though the seed time and the harvest were simultaneous. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."},{"number":10,"verse":"Those that are of the household of faith, that is, those who are joined with us in the profession of one self same religion, ought to be preferred before all others, yet in such a way that our generosity extends to all. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith."},{"number":11,"verse":"The fourth and last part of the epistle, in which he returns to his principal end and purpose: that is, that the Galatians should not allow themselves to be led out of the way by the false apostles. And he points out what those false apostles are really like, reproving them of ambition, as men who do not act because of any affection and zeal they have for the Law, but only for this purpose, that they may purchase themselves favour amongst their own sort, by the circumcision of the Galatians. Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand."},{"number":12,"verse":"As many as desire to make a He sets a fair show against the truth. fair shew in In the keeping of ceremonies. the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the For the preaching of him that was crucified. cross of Christ."},{"number":13,"verse":"For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in That they have entangled you in Judaism, and yet he dwells on the aspect of circumcision. your flesh."},{"number":14,"verse":"He does not dwell in comparing himself with them, showing that on the other hand he rejoices in those afflictions which he suffers for Christ's sake, and as he is despised by the world, so does he in the same way consider the world as wicked. And this is the true circumcision of a true Israelite. But God forbid that I should When Paul uses this word in good sense or way, it signifies to rest a man's self wholly in a thing, and to content himself in it. glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."},{"number":15,"verse":"For in Christ Iesus neither circumcision auaileth any thing, nor vncircumcision, but a newe creature."},{"number":16,"verse":"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Upon the true Israel, whose praise is from God and not from men; (Rom_2:29).
