And he begins with chiding, reproving them of unsteadiness, because they gave ear so easily to those who perverted them and drew them away to a new gospel. I marvel that ye are so soon He uses the passive voice to cast the fault upon the false apostles, and he uses the present voice to show them that it was not completely done, but in the process of being done. removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:"},{"number":7,"verse":"He warns them in time to remember that there are not many Gospels; and therefore whatever these false apostles pretend who had the Law, Moses, and the fathers in their mouths, yet these ones had indeed corrupted the true Gospel. And he himself, indeed, also the very angels themselves (and therefore much more these false apostles) ought to be held accursed, if they go about to change the least thing that may be in the Gospel that he delivered to them before. Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would For there is nothing more contrary to faith or free justification, than justification by the Law or by deeds. pervert the gospel of Christ."},{"number":8,"verse":"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be See (Rom_9:3). accursed."},{"number":9,"verse":"As we sayd before, so say I now againe, If any man preach vnto you otherwise, then that ye haue receiued, let him be accursed."},{"number":10,"verse":"A confirmation taken both from the nature of the doctrine itself, and also from the manner which he used in teachings. For neither, he says, did I teach those things which pleased men, as these men do who put part of salvation in external things, and works of the Law, neither went I about to procure any man's favour. And therefore the matter itself shows that that doctrine which I delivered to you is heavenly. For do I now persuade He refers to the false apostles, who had nothing but flattery in their mouths for men, and he, though he would not detract from the apostles, preaches God, and not to please men. men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ."},{"number":11,"verse":"A second argument to prove that his doctrine is heavenly, because he had it from heaven, from Jesus Christ himself, without any man's help, in which he excels those whom Christ taught here on earth after the manner of men.

For, he says, it is well known in what school I was brought up, even from my childhood, that is, among the deadly enemies of the Gospel. And no man may raise a frivolous objection and say that I was a scholar of the Pharisees in name only, and not in deed, for no man is ignorant of how I excelled in Pharisaism, and was suddenly changed from a Pharisee to an apostle of the Gentiles, so that I had no time to be instructed by men. For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:"},{"number":14,"verse":"And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the He calls them the traditions of his fathers, because he was not only a Pharisee himself, but also had a Pharisee for his father. traditions of my fathers."},{"number":15,"verse":"But when it pleased God, who He speaks of God's everlasting predestination, by which he appointed him to be an apostle, of which he makes three distinctions: the everlasting council of God, his appointing from his mother's womb, and his calling.

Therefore, Paul answers that he began immediately after his calling to preach the Gospel at Damascus and in Arabia, and was not from that time in Jerusalem except for fifteen days, when he saw only Peter and James. And afterwards, he began to teach in Syria and Cilicia, with the consent and approval of the churches of the Jews, who knew him only by name: so far off was it, that he was there instructed by men.
