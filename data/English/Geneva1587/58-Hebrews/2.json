For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the The world to come, of which Christ is Father, (Isa_9:6) or the Church, which as a new world, was to be gathered together by the gospel. world to come, whereof we speak."},{"number":6,"verse":"He shows that the use of this kingly dignity exists in this, that men might not only in Christ recognise the dignity which they have lost, but also might be through him advanced above all things, which dignity of men David describes most excellently. But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is there in man that you should have such a great regard for him, and do him that honour? What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the He refers to all the citizens of the heavenly kingdom as they are considered to be, before God gives them the freedom of that city in Christ, man, and sons of man. son of man, that thou visitest him?"},{"number":7,"verse":"Thou This is the first honour of the citizens of the world to come, that they are beside the angels. madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with For they will be greatly honoured when they partake of the kingdom.

For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him. An objection: But where is this great rule and dominion?

For it became God. him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, First of all because the Father, to whose glory all these things are to be referred, purposed to bring many sons to glory. How could he have men for his sons, unless his only begotten son had become a brother to men? in bringing many sons unto glory, Secondly the Father determined to bring those sons to glory, that is, out of that shame in which they existed before. Therefore the son should not have been seen plainly to be made man, unless he had been made like other men, that he might come to glory in the same way, he would bring others: indeed rather, it suited him who was prince of the salvation of others, to be consecrated above others through those afflictions, Prophet, King, and Priest, which are the offices of that government, for the salvation of others. to make the The Chieftain who as he is chiefest in dignity, so he is first begotten from the dead, among many brethren. captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."},{"number":11,"verse":"The basis for both of the former arguments, for we could not be sons through him, neither could he be consecrated through afflictions, unless he had been made man like us. But because this sonship depends not only on nature, for no man is accounted the son of God, unless he is also a son of a man, he is also Christ's brother, (which is by sanctification, that is, by becoming one with Christ, who sanctifies us through faith) therefore the apostle makes mention of the sanctifier, that is, of Christ, and of them that are sanctified, that is, of all the elect, who Christ condescends to call brethren. For both he that He uses the time to show us that we are still going on, and increasing in this sanctification: and by sanctification he means our separation from the rest of the world, our cleansing from sin, and our dedication wholly to God, all which Christ alone works in us. sanctifieth and they who are sanctified [are] all of One, of the same nature of man. one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,"},{"number":12,"verse":"That which he taught before about the incarnation of Christ, he applies to the prophetic office.

And again, This Isaiah speaks of himself and his disciples but signifying by this all ministers, as also his disciples signify the whole Church.
