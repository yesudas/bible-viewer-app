Therefore he ordained various kinds of duties and sacrifices, to assure them of forgiveness for their offences (if they offered them in true faith and obedience.) Also he appointed the priests and levites, their apparel, offices, conversation and portion; he showed what feasts they should observe, and when. Moreover, he declares by these sacrifices and ceremonies that the reward of sin is death, and that without the blood of Christ the innocent Lamb, there can be no forgiveness of sins.

After declaring these things, he promised favour and blessing to those who keep his laws, and threatened his curse to those who transgressed them."},{"number":2,"verse":"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the So they could offer of no other sort, but of those who were commanded. cattle, [even] of the herd, and of the flock."},{"number":3,"verse":"If his offering [be] a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the Meaning, within the court of the tabernacle. tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD."},{"number":4,"verse":"And he shall put his hande vpon the head of the burnt offering, and it shalbe accepted to the Lorde, to be his atonement."},{"number":5,"verse":"And A priest of the Levites. he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the Of the burnt offering, (Exo_27:1). altar that [is by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then shall he fley the burnt offering, and cut it in pieces."},{"number":7,"verse":"So the sonnes of Aaron the Priest shall put fire vpon the altar, and lay the wood in order vpon the fire."},{"number":8,"verse":"Then the Priestes Aarons sonnes shall lay the parts in order, the head & the kall vpon the wood that is in the fire which is vpon the altar."},{"number":9,"verse":"But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, [to be] a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour Or a savour of rest, which pacifies the anger of the Lord. unto the LORD."},{"number":10,"verse":"And if his sacrifice for the burnt offering be of the flocks (as of the sheepe, or of the goats) he shall offer a male without blemish,"},{"number":11,"verse":"Read (Lev_1:5).
