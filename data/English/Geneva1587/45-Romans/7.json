Are the law and sin the same thing, and do they agree together? No, he says: sin is reproved and condemned by the law. But because sin cannot abide to be reproved, and was not in a manner felt until it was provoked and stirred up by the law, it takes occasion by this to be more outrageous, and yet by no fault of the law. What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known By the word «lust» in this place he does not mean evil lusts themselves, but the fountain from which they come, for the heathen philosophers themselves condemned wicked lusts, though somewhat poorly. But as for the fountain of lust, they could not so much as determine it, and yet it is the very seat of the natural and unclean spot and filth. lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet."},{"number":8,"verse":"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin [was] Though sin is in us, yet it is not known as sin, neither does it rage in the same way that it rages after the law is known. dead."},{"number":9,"verse":"He sets himself before us as an example, in whom all men may behold, first what they are by nature before they earnestly think upon the law of God: that is, stupid, and prone to sin and wickedness, without any true sense and feeling of sin, and second what manner of persons they become, when their conscience is reproved by the testimony of the Law, that is, stubborn and more inflamed with the desire for sin than they ever were before. For I was alive without the When I did not know the law, then I thought that I indeed lived: for my conscience never troubled me, because it was not aware of my disease. law once: but when the commandment When I began to understand the commandment. came, sin revived, and I In sin, or by sin. died."},{"number":10,"verse":"But I died: and the same commandement which was ordeined vnto life, was found to be vnto me vnto death."},{"number":11,"verse":"For sinne tooke occasion by the commandement, and deceiued me, and thereby slewe me."},{"number":12,"verse":"The conclusion: that the law is holy in itself, and that all the fault is in us, the ones who abuse the law. Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the Concerning the commandment, not to covet. commandment holy, and just, and good."},{"number":13,"verse":"The proposition: that the law is not the cause of death, but our corrupt nature being with the law not only discouraged, but also stirred up: and it took occasion by this to rebel, and the more that things are forbidden it, the more it desires them, and the result of this is guiltiness, and occasion of death. Was then that which is good Does it bear the blame for my death? made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might That sin might show itself to be sin, and betray itself to be that which it is indeed. appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might As evil as it could be, showing all the venom it could. become exceeding sinful."},{"number":14,"verse":"The law is the cause of this matter because the it requires a heavenly purity, but when men are born, they are bondslaves of corruption, which they willingly serve. For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."},{"number":15,"verse":"He sets himself before us as an example, since he has been regenerated, and in whom may easily appear the strife of the Spirit and the flesh, and therefore of the law of God, and our wickedness. For since the law in a man who has not been regenerated brings forth only death, therefore in him it may easily be accused: but seeing that in a man who is regenerated it brings forth good fruit, it better appears that evil actions proceed not from the law but from sin, that is, from our corrupt nature: and therefore the apostle teaches also what the true use of the law is by reproving sin in the regenerated, unto the end of the chapter: as a little before (that is, from the seventh verse until now) (Rom_7:7-15), he declared the use of it in those who are not regenerated. For that which I do I The deeds of my life, he says, are not in accordance to my will, rather they are contrary to it. Therefore by the consent of my will with the law, and repugnancy with the deeds of my life, it plainly appears that the law and a properly controlled will induce us to do one thing, but corruption, which also has its seat in the regenerated, another thing. allow not: for what I It is to be noted that the very same man is said to will and not to will, in different respects: that is, he is said to will in that he is regenerated by grace: and not to will in that he is not regenerated, or in that he is in the same state into which he was born. But because the part which is regenerated at length becomes conqueror, therefore Paul, speaking on behalf of the regenerated, speaks in such a way as if the corruption which willingly sins were something outside of a man: although afterward he grants that this evil is in his flesh, or in his members. would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I."},{"number":16,"verse":"If I doe then that which I woulde not, I consent to the Lawe, that it is good."},{"number":17,"verse":"Now then it is no more I that do it, but That natural corruption, which adheres strongly even to those that are regenerated, and is not completely gone. sin that dwelleth in me."},{"number":18,"verse":"This vice, or sin, or law of sin, wholly possesses those men who are not regenerated, and hinders them or holds those back who are regenerated. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but This indeed is appropriate to the man whom the grace of God has made a new man: for where the Spirit is not, how can there be any strife there? [how] to perform that which is good I find not."},{"number":19,"verse":"For I doe not the good thing, which I would, but the euil, which I would not, that do I."},{"number":20,"verse":"Nowe if I do that I would not, it is no more I that doe it, but the sinne that dwelleth in me."},{"number":21,"verse":"The conclusion: as the law of God exhorts to goodness, so does the law of sin (that is, the corruption in which we are born) force us to wickedness: but the spirit, that is, our mind, in that it is regenerated, coexists with the law of God: but the flesh, that is, the whole natural man, is bondslave to the law of sin. Therefore, in short, wickedness and death are not of the law, but of sin, which reigns in those that are not regenerated: for they neither wish to do good, neither do they do good, but they wish and do evil: but in those that are regenerated, it strives against the spirit or law of the mind, so that they cannot live at all as well as they want to, or be as free of sin as they want to. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me."},{"number":22,"verse":"For I delight in the law of God after the The inner man and the new man are the same, and are compared and contrasted with the old man; and neither do these words «inward man» signify man's mind and reason, and the «old man» the physical body that is subject to them, as the philosophers imagine: but by the outward man is meant whatever is either without or within a man from top to bottom, as long as that man is not born again by the grace of God. inward man:"},{"number":23,"verse":"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my The law of the mind in this place is not to be understood as referring to the mind as it is naturally, and as our mind is from our birth, but of the mind which is renewed by the Spirit of God. mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."},{"number":24,"verse":"It is a miserable thing to be yet in part subject to sin, which of its own nature makes us guilty of death: but we must cry to the Lord, who will by death itself at length make us conquerors, as we are already conquerors in Christ. O Wearied with miserable and continual conflicts. wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"},{"number":25,"verse":"I He recovers himself, and shows us that he rests only in Christ. thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I This is the true perfection of those that are born again, to confess that they are imperfect. myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin."}]}
