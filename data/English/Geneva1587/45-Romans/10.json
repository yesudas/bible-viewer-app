For they The ignorance of the law (which we ought to know) does not excuse anyone before God, especially those that are of his household. being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to Ignorance always has pride associated with it. establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."},{"number":4,"verse":"The proof: the law itself points to Christ, that those who believe in him should be saved. Therefore the calling to salvation by the works of the law, is vain and foolish: but Christ is offered for salvation to every believer. For Christ [is] the The end of the law is to justify those that keep the law: but seeing that we do not observe the law through the fault of our flesh, we do not attain this end: but Christ heals this disease, for he fulfils the law for us. end of the law for righteousness to Not only to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles. every one that believeth."},{"number":5,"verse":"That the law is points to Christ and is inclined to him is manifestly proved, because it propounds such a condition as can be and is fulfilled, by none but Christ alone: which being imputed to us by faith, our conscience is quieted, so that now no man can ask, «Who can ascend up into heaven, or bring us from hell?», seeing that the gospel teaches that both of these is done by Christ and that for their sake's, who with true faith embrace him who calls them. For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them."},{"number":6,"verse":"But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Do not think to yourself, as men that are doubting do. Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down [from above]:)"},{"number":7,"verse":"Or, Who shal descend into the deepe?

The By «word», Moses understood the law which the Lord proclaimed with his own voice: and Paul applied it to the preaching of the Gospel, which was the perfection of the law. word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;"},{"number":9,"verse":"That is indeed true faith which is settled not only in the head, but also in the heart of man, of which we also give testimony by our outward life, and which serves Christ as our one and only Saviour, even as he sets forth himself in his word. That if thou shalt If you profess plainly, sincerely, and openly, that you take Jesus alone to be thy Lord and Saviour. confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that The Father, who is said to have raised the Son from the dead: and this is not spoken to exclude the divinity of the Son, but to set forth the Father's plan, with regard to our redemption in the resurrection of the Son. God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."},{"number":10,"verse":"For with the heart man Faith is said to justify, and furthermore seeing the confession of the mouth is an effect of faith, and confession in the way to come to salvation, it follows that faith is also said to save. believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."},{"number":11,"verse":"Now he proves the other part which he propounded before in the fourth verse, that is, that Christ calls whoever he wishes without any difference, and this confirms by a twofold testimony, (Rom_10:4). For the scripture saith, Whosoever To believe in God is to yield and consent to God's promise of our salvation by Christ, and that not only in general, but when we know that the promises pertain to us, from which arises a sure trust. believeth on him shall not be ashamed."},{"number":12,"verse":"For there is no difference betweene the Iewe and the Grecian: for he that is Lorde ouer all, is rich vnto all, that call on him."},{"number":13,"verse":"True calling upon the name of God is the testimony of true faith, and true faith of true vocation or calling, and true calling of true election.

For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?"},{"number":17,"verse":"A conclusion of the former discussion: we must ascend from faith to our calling, for by our calling we came to the testimony of our election. So then faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the By God's commandment. word of God."},{"number":18,"verse":"An objection: if calling is a testimony of election, were not the Jews called?
