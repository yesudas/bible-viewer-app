For in By these words is shown a distinction of the natures. him This word «dwelleth» notes out to us the joining together of those natures, so that God and man, is one Christ. dwelleth These words declare that the perfect Godhead is in Christ. all the fulness of the Godhead The union of God and man, is substantial and essential. bodily."},{"number":10,"verse":"And yee are complete in him, which is the head of all principalitie and power."},{"number":11,"verse":"Now he deals precisely against the third type, that is to say, against those who urged the Jewish religion: and first of all, he denies that we have need of the circumcision of the flesh, seeing that without it we are circumcised within, by the power of Christ. In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the These many words are used to show what the old man is, whom Paul in other places calls the body of sin. body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:"},{"number":12,"verse":"The taking away of an objection: we do not need an external sign to the extent which our fathers had, seeing that our baptism is a most effectual pledge and witness, of that inward restoring and renewing. See (Rom_6:4). Buried with So then all the force of the matter comes not from the very deed done, that is to say, it is not the dipping of us into the water by a minister that makes us to be buried with Christ, as the papists say, that even by the very act's sake we become very Christians, but it comes from the power of Christ, for the apostle adds the resurrection of Christ, and faith. him in baptism, One purpose of baptism is to symbolise the death and burial of the old man, and that by the mighty power of God alone, whose power we lay hold on by faith, in the death and resurrection of Christ. wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of the operation of Through faith which comes from God.

And you, being dead in your sins A new argument which lies in these few words, and it is this: uncircumcision was no hindrance to you in obtaining life, because you were justified in Christ; therefore you do not need circumcision for the attainment of salvation. and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;"},{"number":14,"verse":"He speaks now more generally against the whole service of the Law, and shows by two reasons, that it is abolished. First, to what purpose would he that has obtained remission of all his sins in Christ, require those helps of the Law? Secondly, because if a man rightly considers those rites, he will find that they were so many testimonies of our guiltiness, by which we manifestly witnessed as it were by our own handwritings, that we deserved damnation. Therefore Christ put out that handwriting by his coming, and fastening it to the cross, triumphed over all our enemies, were they ever so mighty. Therefore to what end and purpose should we now use those ceremonies, as though we were still guilty of sin, and subject to the tyranny of our enemies?

Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]:"},{"number":17,"verse":"Which are a shadow of things to come; but the The body as a thing of substance and physical strength, he sets against shadows. body [is] of Christ."},{"number":18,"verse":"He disputes against the first type of corruptions, and sets down the worshipping of angels as an example: which type of false religion he refutes, first, this way: because those who bring in such a worship, attribute that to themselves which is proper only to God, that is, authority to bind men's consciences with religion, even though they seem to bring in these things by humility of mind. Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary By foolish humility of mind: for otherwise humility is a virtue. For these angel worshippers blamed those of pride who would go straight to God, and use no other means besides Christ. humility and worshipping of angels, Secondly, because they rashly thrust upon them as oracles those things which they neither saw nor heard, but devised by themselves. intruding into those things which he hath not seen, Thirdly, because these things have no other ground upon which they are built, but only the opinion of men, who please themselves immensely in their own devices.

And he uses an argument taken of comparison. If by the death of Christ who established a new covenant with his blood, you are delivered from those external rites with which it pleased the Lord to prepare the world, as it were by certain rudiments, to that full knowledge of true religion, why would you be burdened with traditions, I know not what, as though you were citizens of this world, that is to say, as though you depended upon this life, and earthly things? Now this is the reason why before verse eight he followed another order than he does in the refutation: because he shows by this what degrees false religions came into the world, that is, beginning first by curious speculations of the wise, after which in process of time succeeded gross superstition, against which mischiefs the Lord set at length that service of the Law, which some abused in like sort. But in the refutation he began with the abolishing of the Law service, that he might show by comparison, that those false services ought much more to be taken away. Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, As though your felicity stood in these earthly things, and the kingdom of God was not rather spiritual. as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,"},{"number":21,"verse":"An imitation of these superstitious men, rightly expressing their nature and use of speech.(Touch not; taste not; handle not;"},{"number":22,"verse":"Another argument: the spiritual and inward kingdom of God cannot consist in these outward things, which perish with the using. Which all are to perish with the using;) The third argument: because God is not the author of these traditions, therefore they are not that which we are obligated to do. after the commandments and doctrines of men?"},{"number":23,"verse":"The taking away of an objection. These things have a good appearance, because men by this means seem to worship God with a good mind, and humble themselves, and neglect the body, which the most part of men curiously pamper and cherish. But yet nonetheless the things themselves are of no value, for they do not pertain to the things that are spiritual and everlasting, but to the nourishment of the flesh.
