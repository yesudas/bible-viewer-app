For he shows that we who are otherwise by nature sinners, were through the free mercy of God the Father first chosen from everlasting: then according to that everlasting decree. We were by a certain second creation made his sons in Christ his only begotten, by whose Spirit we are inwardly changed and by whose blood we are also reconciled. To the end, that as Christ himself rose again from the dead, we also might be received into that same heavenly and everlasting glory. Elect according to the Or, according to the purpose of God, who never alters nor changes the same. foreknowledge of God the Father, through That being set apart from the rest of this wicked world, through the working of the Holy Spirit, they should be consecrated to God; (Eph_1:5) sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied."},{"number":3,"verse":"Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a Everlasting hope. lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"},{"number":4,"verse":"To an inheritance immortall and vndefiled, and that withereth not, reserued in heauen for vs,"},{"number":5,"verse":"Now he shows by what way we come to that glory, that is, through all types of afflictions. Wherein nonetheless faith maketh us so secure, that we are not overcome with sorrow. But through the beholding of God himself (who otherwise is invisible) with the eyes of faith, we are made unspeakably joyful. Because all such things, as they are but for a time, so are they not applied unto us to destroy us, but as it were by fire to purge us, and to make us perfect that at length we may obtain salvation. Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the This is that time which Daniel calls the time of the end, when the great restoring of all things shall be, which all creation looks for; (Rom_8:19) last time."},{"number":6,"verse":"Wherein yee reioyce, though nowe for a season (if neede require) yee are in heauinesse, through manifolde tentations,"},{"number":7,"verse":"That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the He speaks of the second coming of Christ. appearing of Jesus Christ:"},{"number":8,"verse":"Whome yee haue not seene, and yet loue him, in whome nowe, though yee see him not, yet doe you beleeue, and reioyce with ioy vnspeakeable and glorious,"},{"number":9,"verse":"Receiuing the ende of your faith, euen the saluation of your soules."},{"number":10,"verse":"He makes a difference between true faith, that is to say, that faith which only has an eye to the doctrine of the prophets and apostles, and false faith. Afterward he makes two degrees of one and the same faith, according to the manner of the various revelations, when as in deed it is but one only faith. Thirdly, he says that the preaching of the apostles is the fulfilling of the preaching of the prophets, although the latter end of it be as yet looked for by the very angels. Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace [that should come] unto you:"},{"number":11,"verse":"Searching when or what time the Spirite which testified before of Christ which was in them, shoulde declare the sufferings that should come vnto Christ, and the glorie that shoulde followe."},{"number":12,"verse":"Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost He alludes to the prophecy of Joel, which was exhibited upon the day of Pentecost, in the Apostles, as it were in the first fruits of the Holy Spirit, which this same prophecy Peter declares; (Act_2:6) sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into."},{"number":13,"verse":"He goes from faith to hope, which is indeed a companion that cannot be separated from faith. He uses an argument taken by comparison: We should not be wearied in looking for so excellent a thing, which the very angels wait for with great desire. Wherefore This is a borrowed speech, taken from common use among them: for since they wore long garments, they could not travel unless they girded up themselves: and hence it is that Christ said, Let your loins be girded up. gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and He sets forth very briefly, what manner of hope ours ought to be, that is, continual, until we enjoy the thing we hope for: then, what we have to hope for, that is, grace (that is, free salvation) revealed to us in the gospel, and not that, that men do rather and fondly promise to themselves. hope Soundly and sincerely. to the end for the grace An argument to stir up our minds, seeing that God does not wait until we seek him, but causes so great a benefit to be brought even unto us. that is to be brought unto you He sets out the end of faith, lest any man should promise himself, either sooner or latter, that full salvation, that is, the latter coming of Christ. In addition warns that that which we are now, is not yet revealed. at the revelation of Jesus Christ;"},{"number":14,"verse":"He passes from faith and hope, to the fruits of them both, which are understood in the name of obedience. It consists in two things, in renouncing our lusts, and living godly: which lusts have their beginning in that blindness in which all men are born: but holiness proceeds that the father and the children may be of one disposition. As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:"},{"number":15,"verse":"But as hee which hath called you, is holie, so be yee holie in all maner of conuersation;"},{"number":16,"verse":"He shows that sanctification does necessarily follow adoption.

The apostle answers, that Christ was ordained and appointed to redeem and deliver mankind, before mankind was: much less was there any Church without him before his coming in the flesh: yet we are happiest about the rest, to whom Christ was exhibited indeed, in this that he having suffered and overcome death for us, does now most effectually work in us by the power of his Spirit, to create in us faith, hope, and charity.

But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you."}]}
