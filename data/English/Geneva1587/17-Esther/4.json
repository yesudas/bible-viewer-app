(13:10) For thou hast made heauen and earth, and all the wonderous things vnder the heauen. (13:11) Thou art Lorde of all thinges, and there is no man that can resist thee, which art the Lord. (13:12) Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it was neither of malice, nor presumption, nor for any desire of glory, that I did this, and not bowe downe to proude Aman. (13:13) For I woulde haue bene content with good will for the saluation of Israel, to haue kist the sole of his feete. (13:14) But I did it, because I would not preferre the honour of a man aboue the glory of God, & would not worship any but onely thee, my Lorde, and this haue I not done of pride. (13:15) And therefore, O Lord God and King, haue mercy vpon thy people: for they imagine how they may bring vs to naught, yea, they would destroy the inheritance, that hath bin thine from the beginning. (13:16) Despise not the portion, which thou hast deliuered out of Egypt for thine owne selfe. (13:17) Heare my prayer, and bee mercifull vnto thy portion: turne our sorow into ioy, that we may liue, O Lord, and praise thy Name: shut not the mouthes of them that praise thee. (13:18) All Israel in like maner cried most earnestly vnto the Lord, because that death was before their eyes. \\par (14:1) Qveene Esther also, being in danger of death, resorted vnto the Lord, (14:2) And layd away her glorious apparell, and put on the garments of sighing, and mourning. In the stead of precious oyntment, she scattered ashes, and dongue vpon her head: and she humbled her body greatly with fasting, and all the places of her ioy filled she with the heare that she pluckt off. (14:3) And she prayed vnto the Lord God of Israel, saying, O my Lorde, thou onely art our King: helpe me desolate woman, which haue no helper but thee. (14:4) For my danger is at hand. (14:5) From my youth vp I haue heard in the kinred of my father, that thou, O Lord, tookest Israel from among all people, and our fathers from their predecessours for a perpetuall inheritance, and thou hast performed that which thou didest promise them. (14:6) Now Lord, we haue sinned before thee: therefore hast thou giuen vs into ye hands of our enemies. (14:7) Because we worshipped their gods, O Lorde, thou art righteous. (14:8) Neuerthelesse, it satisfieth them not, that we are in bitter captiuitie, but they haue stroken hands with their idoles, (14:9) That they wil abolish the thing that thou with thy mouth hast ordeined, & destroy thine inheritace, to shut vp the mouth of them that praise thee, and to quench the glory of thy Temple, and of thine altar, (14:10) And to open the mouths of the heathen, that they may praise the power of the idoles, and to magnifie a fleshly King for euer. (14:11) O Lord, giue not thy scepter vnto them that be nothing, lest they laugh vs to scorne in our miserie: but turne their deuise vpon theselues, and make him an example, that hath begunne the same against vs. (14:12) Thinke vpon vs, O Lord, and shewe thy selfe vnto vs in the time of our distresse, and strengthen me, O King of gods, and Lord of all power. (14:13) Giue me an eloquent speach in my mouth before the Lion: turne his heart to hate our enemie, to destroy him, and all such as consent vnto him. (14:14) But deliuer vs with thine hand, and helpe me that am solitary, which haue no defence but onely thee. (14:15) Thou knowest all things, O Lord: thou knowest, that I hate the glory of the vnrighteous, and that I abhorre the bed of the vncircumcised, and of all the heathen. (14:16) Thou knowest my necessitie: for I hate this token of my preeminence, which I beare vpon mine head, what time as I must shewe my selfe, and that I abhorre it as a menstruous cloth, and that I weare it not when I am alone by my selfe, (14:17) And that I thine handmayde haue not eaten at Amans table, and that I haue had no pleasure in the Kings feast, nor drunke the wine of the drinke offerings, (14:18) And that I thine handmayde haue no ioye since the day that I was brought hither, vntill this day, but in thee, O Lord God of Abraham. (14:19) O thou mighty God aboue al, heare the voyce of them, that haue none other hope, & deliuer vs out of the hand of ye wicked, & deliuer me out of my feare.}"}]}
