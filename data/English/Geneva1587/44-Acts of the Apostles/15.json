Epiphanius is of the opinion that this was Cerinthus. certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, [and said], Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved."},{"number":2,"verse":"Meetings of congregations were instituted to suppress heresies, to which certain were sent by common consent on behalf of all.
