And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore."},{"number":3,"verse":"Then he spake many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sowe."},{"number":4,"verse":"And as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the foules came and deuoured them vp."},{"number":5,"verse":"And some fell vpon stony grounde, where they had not much earth, and anon they sprong vp, because they had no depth of earth."},{"number":6,"verse":"And when the sunne was vp, they were parched, and for lacke of rooting, withered away."},{"number":7,"verse":"And some fell among thornes, and the thornes sprong vp, and choked them."},{"number":8,"verse":"Some againe fel in good ground, & brought forth fruite, one corne an hundreth folde, some sixtie folde, and another thirtie folde."},{"number":9,"verse":"He that hath eares to heare, let him heare."},{"number":10,"verse":"Then the disciples came, and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?"},{"number":11,"verse":"The gift of understanding and faith is given only to the elect, and all the rest are blinded through the just judgment of God.

Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare."},{"number":44,"verse":"Few men understand how great the riches of the kingdom of heaven are, and that no man can be a partaker of them but he that redeems them with the loss of all his goods. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field."},{"number":45,"verse":"Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like to a marchant man, that seeketh good pearles,"},{"number":46,"verse":"Who hauing found a pearle of great price, went and solde all that he had, and bought it."},{"number":47,"verse":"There are many in the Church who nevertheless are not of the Church, and therefore at length will be cast out: but the full and perfect cleansing of them is deferred to the last day.

The Angels shall goe foorth, and seuer the bad from among the iust,"},{"number":50,"verse":"And shall cast them into a fornace of fire: there shalbe wailing, and gnashing of teeth."},{"number":51,"verse":"They ought to be diligent, who have to be wise not only for themselves, but who have to dispense the wisdom of God to others. Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord."},{"number":52,"verse":"Then sayd hee vnto them, Therefore euery Scribe which is taught vnto the kingdome of heauen, is like vnto an householder, which bringeth foorth out of his treasure things both newe and olde."},{"number":53,"verse":"And it came to passe, that when Iesus had ended these parables, he departed thence,"},{"number":54,"verse":"Men not only sin because of ignorance, but also knowingly and willingly they lay stumbling blocks in their own ways, that when God calls them, they may not obey, and so most plainly destroy and cast away themselves. And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this [man] this wisdom, and [these] mighty works?"},{"number":55,"verse":"Is not this the carpenters sonne?
