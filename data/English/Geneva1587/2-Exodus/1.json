The Argument - After Jacob by God's commandment in (Gen_46:3) had brought his family into Egypt, where they remained for four hundred years, and from seventy people grew to an infinite number so that the king and the country endeavoured both by tyranny and cruel slavery to suppress them: the Lord according to his promise in (Gen_15:14) had compassion on his Church, and delivered them, but plagued their enemies in most strange and varied ways. The more the tyranny of the wicked raged against his Church, the more his heavy judgments increased against them, till Pharaoh and his army were drowned in the sea, which gave an entry and passage to the children of God. As the ingratitude of man is great, so they immediately forgot God's wonderful benefits and although he had given them the Passover as a sign and memorial of the same, yet they fell to distrust, and tempted God with various complaining and grudging against him and his ministers: sometimes out of ambition, sometimes lack of drink or meat to satisfy their lusts, sometimes idolatry, or such like. For this reason, God punished them with severe rods and plagues, that by his correction they might turn to him for help against his scourges, and earnestly repent for their rebellion and wickedness. Because God loves them to the end, whom he has once begun to love, he punished them not as they deserved, but dealt with them mercifully, and with new benefits laboured to overcome their malice: for he still governed them and gave them his word and Law, both concerning the way to serve him, and also the form of judgments and civil policy: with the intent that they would not serve God after as they pleased, but according to the order, that his heavenly wisdom had appointed."},{"number":2,"verse":"Reuben, Simeon, Leui, and Iudah,"},{"number":3,"verse":"Issachar, Zebulun, and Beniamin,"},{"number":4,"verse":"Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."},{"number":5,"verse":"So al the soules, that came out of the loines of Iaakob, were seuentie soules: Ioseph was in Egypt already."},{"number":6,"verse":"Nowe Ioseph died and all his brethren, and that whole generation."},{"number":7,"verse":"And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the He means the country of Goshen. land was filled with them."},{"number":8,"verse":"Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which He did not consider how God had preserved Egypt for the sake of Joseph. knew not Joseph."},{"number":9,"verse":"And he sayde vnto his people, Beholde, the people of the children of Israel are greater and mightier then we."},{"number":10,"verse":"Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and [so] Into Canaan, and so we shall lose our conveniences. get them up out of the land."},{"number":11,"verse":"Therefore did they set taskemasters ouer them, to keepe the vnder with burdens: and they built the cities Pithom and Raamses for the treasures of Pharaoh."},{"number":12,"verse":"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.
