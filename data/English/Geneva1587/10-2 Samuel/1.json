The first book contains those things which God brought to pass among this people under the government of Samuel and Saul. This second book declares the noble acts of David, after the death of Saul when he began to reign, to the end of his kingdom, and how it was expanded by him. It also contains the great troubles and dangers he sustained both within his house and without, the horrible and dangerous insurrections, uproars, and treasons wrought against him, partly by false counsellors, feigned friends and flatterers and partly by his own children and people. By God's assistance he overcame all difficulties, and enjoyed his kingdom in rest and peace. In the person of David the scripture sets forth Christ Jesus the chief king, who came from David according to the flesh, and was persecuted on every side with outward and inward enemies, as well in his own person, as in his members, but at length he overcomes all his enemies, and gives his Church victory against all power both spiritual and temporal; and so reigns with them, king for ever."},{"number":2,"verse":"It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with Seeming to lament the overthrow of the people of Israel. his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and [so] it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance."},{"number":3,"verse":"Then Dauid saide vnto him, Whence commest thou?
