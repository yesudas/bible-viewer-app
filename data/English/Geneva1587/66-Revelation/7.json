Then thanks are given by the elect for that cause (Rev_7:10-12). Lastly, the accomplishment of it is set forth to the end of the chapter. The first verse is a transition, speaking of the angels who keep the lesser parts from harm, until God commands. For, as in (Eze_10:19), their faces and their wings reach up, continually waiting on and watching the countenance of God for their direction and every one of them goes into that part that is right before his face: wherever the Spirit goes, they go, they do not step out of the way, not so much as a foot breadth from the path commanded to them by God. after these things I saw four angels standing on the On the four corners or coasts of the earth. four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, That is, neither into the air, into which the trees grow. nor on any tree."},{"number":2,"verse":"Now God provides against the danger of his elect, by his commandment (Rev_7:23), and by sign or figure, both for those of the nation of the Jews and also for the Gentiles (Rev_7:9).

Here the tribe of Levi is listed with the rest, because all the Israelites were equally made priests with them in Christ by his priesthood (Rom_12:1; 1Pe_2:9; Rev_1:6; Rev_5:10). Dan is not mentioned, because the Danites long before forsaking the worship of God, were fallen away from the fellowship of God's people, to the part of the Gentiles: which evil many ages before Jacob foresaw (Gen_49:17-18), and because of which no mention is made of this tribe in the book of Chronicles.
