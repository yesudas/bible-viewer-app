{"bibleAbbr":"Geneva1587","bookName":"Revelation","bookEnglishName":"Revelation","chapterNumber":19,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"And This chapter has in summary two parts, one transitory or of passage to the things that follow, to the tenth verse, (Rev_19:2-10), another historical of the victory of Christ over both the beasts, to the end of the chapter (Rev_19:11-21), which I said was the second history of this argument, (Rev_17:1). The transition has two places, one of praising God for the overthrow done to Babylon in (Rev_19:4): and another likewise of praise and prophecy, for the coming of Christ to his kingdom, and his most royal marriage with his Church, thence to the tenth verse (Rev_19:5-10). The former praise has three parts, distinguished after the ancient manner of those that sing: an invitation in (Rev_19:1-2), a response or answer in (Rev_19:3), and a close or joining together in harmony in (Rev_19:4), all which I thought good of purpose to distinguish in this place, lest any man should with Porphyrius, or other like dogs, object to John, or the heavenly Church, a childish and idle repetition of speech. after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Praise the Lord. The proposition of praise with exhortation in this verse, and the cause of it in (Rev_19:2). Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:"},{"number":2,"verse":"For true and righteous are his iudgements: for he hath condemned that great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath auenged the blood of his seruants shed by her hand."},{"number":3,"verse":"And again they said, The song of the Antiphony or response, containing an amplification of the praise of God, from the continuous and certain testimony of his divine judgment as was done at Sodom and Gomorrah, (Gen. 19:1-38). Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever."},{"number":4,"verse":"And the foure & twentie Elders, and the foure beastes fell downe, and worshipped God that sate on the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelu-iah."},{"number":5,"verse":"The second place of praise, as I said {{See Rev_19:1}} which first is commanded by God in this verse: and then is in most ample manner pronounced by the creatures, both because they see that kingdom of Christ to come, which they desire, (Rev_19:6) and also because they see the Church is called forth to be brought home to the house of her husband by holy marriage, to the fellowship of his kingdom, (Rev_19:7-8). Therefore John is commanded to write in a book the acclamation together with a divine testimony, (Rev_19:9). And a voice came out of the Out of the temple from God as in (Rev_11:19). throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great."},{"number":6,"verse":"And I heard Outside the temple in heaven. as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth."},{"number":7,"verse":"Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath Namely, to that holy marriage, both herself in person in this verse, and also provided by her spouse with marriage gifts princely and divine, is adorned and prepared in the next verse. made herself ready."},{"number":8,"verse":"And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in As an ensign of kingly and priestly dignity, which Christ bestows on us in (Rev_1:6). fine linen, clean and white: for the fine This is a gift given by the husband for marriage sake, and a most choice ornament which Christ gave to us, as to his spouse. linen is the Good works which are lively testimonies of faith. righteousness of saints."},{"number":9,"verse":"Namely the angel, as it appears by the next verse. And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed [are] they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God."},{"number":10,"verse":"The particular history of this verse is brought in by occasion, and as it were besides the purpose that John might make a public example of his own infirmity and of the modest sanctimony of the angel, who both renounced for himself the divine honours, and recalled all the servants of God, to the worship of him alone: as also (Rev_22:8). And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See [thou do it] not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the Who are commanded to bear witness of Jesus. testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of For Jesus is the mark that all the prophecies shoot at. Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."},{"number":11,"verse":"The second part of this chapter (as I said in) {{See Rev_19:1}} is of the victory gained by Christ against both the beasts: in which first Christ is described as one ready to fight, to the sixteenth verse (Rev_19:12-16), then the battle is shown to begin, there to the eighteenth verse (Rev_19:17-18), lastly is set forth the victory, to the end the chapter (Rev_19:19-21). In this place the most excellent properties of Christ as our heavenly judge and avenger shine forth, according to his person, company, effects and names. And I saw Properties belonging to his person, that he is heavenly, judge, faithful, true, just, in this verse, knowing all things, ruling over all, to be known by no one, (Rev_19:12), the triumpher and in essence, the Word of God, in (Rev_19:13). heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him [was] called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war."},{"number":12,"verse":"And his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crownes: and he had a name written, that no man knewe but himselfe."},{"number":13,"verse":"And he was clothed with a garment dipt in blood, and his name is called The worde of God."},{"number":14,"verse":"The company or retinue of Christ, holy, innumerable, heavenly, judicial, royal and pure. And the armies [which were] in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean."},{"number":15,"verse":"The effects of Christ prepared to fight, that with his mouth he strikes the Gentiles, rules and destroys. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."},{"number":16,"verse":"The name agreeing to Christ according to the former qualities, expressed after the manner of the Hebrews. And he hath on [his] vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."},{"number":17,"verse":"The second part, as I said in {{See Rev_19:11}}. A reproachful calling forth of his enemies into battle: in which not themselves (for why should they be called forth by the king of the world, or provoked being his subjects? for that is not comely) but in their hearing, the birds of the air are called to eat their carcasses.

Two things pertain to this: his fighting with the beast and his forces, in this verse: and the event most magnificent, described after the manner of men, in the verses following. All these things are plain. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army."},{"number":20,"verse":"And the beast Namely, that beast with seven heads; (Rev_13:1; Rev_17:3). was taken, and with him That is, that beast with two heads; (Rev_13:11; Rev_16:14). the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.
