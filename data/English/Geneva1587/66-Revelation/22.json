The effects proceeding from God, who dwells in the Church, are these: the everlasting grace of God, in this verse, the eternal life of the godly, as in (Rev_2:7) the eternal fruits which the godly bring forth to God, themselves and others, (Rev_22:2), freedom and immunity from all evil, God himself taking pleasure in his servants, and they likewise in their God, (Rev_22:3). The beholding and sight of God, and sealing of the faithful from all eternity, (Rev_22:4) the light of God and an everlasting kingdom and glory, (Rev_22:5). he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb."},{"number":2,"verse":"In the middes of the street of it, and of either side of ye riuer, was the tree of life, which bare twelue maner of fruits, and gaue fruit euery moneth: and the leaues of the tree serued to heale the nations with."},{"number":3,"verse":"And there shalbe no more curse, but ye throne of God and of the Lambe shall be in it, and his seruants shall serue him."},{"number":4,"verse":"And they shall see his face, and his Name shalbe in their foreheads."},{"number":5,"verse":"And there shalbe no night there, and they neede no candle, neither light of the sunne: for the Lorde God giueth them light, and they shall reigne for euermore."},{"number":6,"verse":"This whole book is concluded and made up by a confirmation, and a salutation. The confirmation has three parts: the words of the angel (Rev_22:15), the words of Christ, (Rev_22:16-17) and the supplication made by John from divine authority, (Rev_22:18-20). By the speech of the angel this prophecy is confirmed to (Rev_22:7-8), and then he speaks of the use of this book in the verses following. The prophecy is first confirmed by the angel from the nature of it, that it is faithful and true: Secondly, from the nature of the efficient cause, both principal, which is God, and instrumental, which is the angel in this verse. Thirdly, from the promises of God concerning his coming to effect all these things, and concerning our salvation; (Rev_22:7). Fourthly, from the testification of John himself; (Rev_22:8). The rest of the speech of the angel rending to the same end, John interrupted or broke off by his unadvised act of worshipping him, in the same verse, which the angel forbidding, teaches him that adoration must be given not to him, but only to God, as for himself, that he is of such nature and office, as he may not be adored: which thing also was in like manner done; (Rev_19:10). And he said unto me, These sayings [are] faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done."},{"number":7,"verse":"Beholde, I come shortly. Blessed is hee that keepeth the woordes of the prophecie of this booke."},{"number":8,"verse":"And I am Iohn, which sawe and heard these thinges: and when I had heard and seene, I fell downe to worship before the feete of the Angell which shewed me these things."},{"number":9,"verse":"But he sayde vnto me, See thou doe it not: for I am thy fellowe seruaunt, and of thy brethren the Prophets, and of them which keepe the woordes of this booke: worship God."},{"number":10,"verse":"The angel returns to his former speech: in which he teaches to use of this book both towards ourselves, in this and the next verse: and in respect of God for declaration of his truth, there to the fifteenth verse (Rev_22:11-15). And he saith unto me, That is, propound this prophecy openly to all and conceal no part of it. The contrary to that which is commanded in (Isa_8:16; Dan_8:26). Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand."},{"number":11,"verse":"An objection anticipated, but there will be some that will use this occasion for evil, and will wrest this scripture to their own destruction, as Peter says. What then? says the angel, the mysteries of God must not be concealed, which it has pleased him to communicate to us. Let them be harmful to others, let such be more and more vile in themselves, whom this scripture does not please: yet others will be further conformed to righteousness by this, and true holiness. The care and reformation of these may not be neglected, because of the voluntary and malicious offence of others. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still."},{"number":12,"verse":"The second part belonging to the use of this book, as I said {{See Rev_22:10}}. Also (says God by the angel) though there should be no use of this book to men: yet it shall be of this use to me, that it is a witness of my truth to my glory, who will come shortly, to give and execute just judgment, in this verse; who have taught that all these things have their being in me, (Rev_22:13), and have pronounced blessedness to my servants in the Church, (Rev_22:14) and reprobation to the ungodly (Rev_22:15). And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward [is] with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."},{"number":13,"verse":"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ende, the first and the last."},{"number":14,"verse":"Blessed [are] they that do his commandments, The blessedness of the godly set down by their title and interest there: and their fruit in the same. that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."},{"number":15,"verse":"For without shall be dogges and enchanters, and whoremongers, and murtherers, and idolaters, and whosoeuer loueth or maketh lies."},{"number":16,"verse":"The second passage of confirmation (as I said) is the speech of Christ ratifying the vocation of John, and the authority of his calling and testimony, both from the condition of his own person being God and man, in whom all the promises of God are Yea and Amen; (2Co_1:20) and also from the testimony of other people, by the acclamation of the Holy Spirit, who here is an honourable assistant of the marriage of the Church as the spouse: and of each of the godly as members; and finally from the thing present, that of their own knowledge and accord, they are called forth to the participation of the good things of God; (Gen_22:17). I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, [and] the bright and morning star."},{"number":17,"verse":"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come; let him that heareth, say, Come: and let him that is a thirst, come: and let whosoeuer will, take of the water of life freely."},{"number":18,"verse":"The supplication of John (which is the third part of the confirmation) joined with a curse of abhorrence, to preserve the truth of this book entire and uncorrupted in two verses. For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:"},{"number":19,"verse":"And if any man shall diminish of the wordes of the booke of this prophecie, God shall take away his part out of the Booke of life, and out of the holie citie, and from those things which are written in this booke."},{"number":20,"verse":"A divine confirmation or sealing of the supplication first from Christ affirming the same and denouncing his coming against all those that will put their sacrilegious hands here: then from John himself, who by a most holy prayer calls Christ to take vengeance on them. He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."},{"number":21,"verse":"The apostolic salutation, which is the other part of the conclusion, as I said {{See Rev_22:6}} and is the end of almost every epistle; which we wish to the Church, and to all the holy and elect members of it, in Christ Jesus our Lord, until his coming to judgment «Come Lord Jesus» and do it. Amen, again Amen. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen."}]}
