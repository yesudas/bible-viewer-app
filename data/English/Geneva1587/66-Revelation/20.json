This part must necessarily be joined with the end of the twelfth chapter and be applied to the correct understanding of it. This chapter has two parts, one of the dragon overcome, to (Rev_20:2-10): the other of the resurrection and last judgment to (Rev_20:11-15). The story of the dragon is twofold: First of the first victory, after which he was bound by Christ, to the sixth verse (Rev_20:1-6). The second is of the last victory, by which he has thrown down into everlasting punishment, there to the fifteenth verse (Rev_20:7-15).

For which cause I gave warning, that this story of the dragon must be joined to that passage.

The thousandth year falls precisely on the times of that wicked Hildebrand, who was called Gregory the seventh, a most damnable necromancer and sorcerer, whom Satan used as an instrument when he was loosed out of bonds, from then on to annoy the saints of God with most cruel persecutions, and the whole world with dissentions, and most bloody wars: as Benno the Cardinal reports at large. This is the first victory gained over the dragon in the earth. a thousand years,"},{"number":3,"verse":"And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations Namely, with that public and violent deceit which he attempted before in chapter 12 and which after a thousand years (alas for woe!) he most mightily achieved in the Christian world. no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed Which being once expired, the second battle and victory shall be; (Rev_20:7-8). a little season."},{"number":4,"verse":"A description of the common state of the Church of Christ in earth in that space of a thousand years, during which the devil was in bonds; in which first the authority, life, and common honour of the godly, is declared, (Rev_20:4).
