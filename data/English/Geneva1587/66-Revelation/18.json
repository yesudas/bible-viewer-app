This historical prediction concerning her, is threefold. The first a plain and simple foretelling of her ruin, in three verses (Rev_18:2-3). The second a figurative prediction by the circumstances, from there to (Rev. 18:4-20). The third, a confirmation of the same by sign or wonder, to the end of the chapter (Rev_18:21-24)."},{"number":2,"verse":"The prediction of her ruin, containing both the fall of Babylon, in this verse, and the cause of it uttered by way of allegory concerning her spiritual and carnal wickedness, that is, her most great impiety and injustice, in (Rev_18:3). Her fall is first declared by the angel, and then the greatness of it is shown here, by the events when he says it shall be the seat and habitation of devils, of wild beasts, and of cursed souls, as in (Isa_13:21) and often elsewhere. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird."},{"number":3,"verse":"For all nations haue drunken of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the Kings of the earth haue committed fornication with her, and the marchants of the earth are waxed rich of the abundance of her pleasures."},{"number":4,"verse":"The second prediction, which is of the circumstances of the ruin of Babylon: of these there are two types: one going before it, as beforehand the godly are delivered, to the ninth verse (Rev_18:5-9): the other following on her ruin, namely the lamentation of the wicked, and rejoicing of the godly, to the twentieth verse (Rev_18:10-20). And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Two circumstance going before the ruin, are commanded in this place: one is that the godly depart out of Babylon: as I mentioned in chapter twelve to have been done in time past, before the destruction of Jerusalem: this charge is given here and in the next verse. The other is, that every one of them occupy themselves in their own place, in executing the judgment of God, as it was commanded of the Levites in (Exo_32:27) and that they sanctify their hands to the Lord. Come out of her, my people, that ye Of this commandment there are two causes: to avoid the contamination of sin and to shun the participation of those punishments that belong to it. be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."},{"number":5,"verse":"For her sins have He uses a word which signifies the following of sins one after another, and rising one of another in such sort, that they grow at length to such a heap, that they come up even to heaven. reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities."},{"number":6,"verse":"The provocation of the godly, and the commandment of executing the judgment of God, stand on three causes which are here expressed: the unjust wickedness of the whore of Babylon, in this verse, her cursed pride opposing itself against God, which is the fountain of all evil actions, (Rev_18:7) and her most just damnation by the sentence of God, (Rev_18:8). Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double."},{"number":7,"verse":"How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith With herself. in her heart, I sit a queen, and am I am full of people and mighty. no widow, and shall I shall taste of none. see no sorrow."},{"number":8,"verse":"Therefore shall her plagues come in Shortly, and at one instant. one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong [is] the Lord God who judgeth her."},{"number":9,"verse":"And The circumstances following the fall of Babylon, or the consequences of it (as I distinguished them in) {{See Rev_18:4}} are two. Namely the lamentation of the wicked to (Rev_18:5-19) and the rejoicing of the godly in (Rev_18:20). This sorrowful lamentation, according to those that lament, has three parts: the first of which is the mourning of the kings and mighty men of the earth, (Rev_18:9-10): The second is, the lamentation of the merchants that trade by land, to the sixteenth verse: (Rev_18:11-16). The third is, the wailing of those that trade by sea, in (Rev_18:16-18). In each of those the cause and manner of their mourning is described in order, according to the condition of those that mourn, with observation of that which best agrees to them. the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,"},{"number":10,"verse":"And shall stand a farre off for feare of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great citie Babylon, that mightie citie: for in one houre is thy iudgemet come."},{"number":11,"verse":"The lamentation of those that trade by land, as I distinguished before.

And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast [it] into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all."},{"number":22,"verse":"The events are two, and one of them opposite to the other for amplification sake.
