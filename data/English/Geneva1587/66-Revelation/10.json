This story goes from here to (Rev_22:1). This whole chapter is a transition from the common history of the world to that which is particular of the Church. There are in this transition or passage, two preparatives as it were, to this Church story comprised in this whole chapter. One is the authority of Christ revealing his mysteries and calling his servant, to (Rev_10:7). The other is John, his calling proper to this place, and repeated from before to the end of this chapter. Authority is given to this revelation, by these things: first, by the appearing from heaven in this habit and countenance, strong, ready glorious surveying all things by his providence, and governing them by his omnipotence (Rev_10:1). Secondly, that he brought not by chance, but out of a book, this open revelation, set forth to the eye, to signify the same to the sea and land, as the Lord over all (Rev_10:2). Thirdly that he offered the same not whispering or muttering in a corner (as false prophets do) but crying out with a loud voice to those who sleep, and with a lionish and terrible noise roused the secure: the very thunders themselves giving testimony to it (Rev_10:3). Lastly, for that he confirmed all by another (Rev_10:5-7). I saw Christ Jesus, see (Rev_7:2) another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow [was] upon his head, and his face [was] as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:"},{"number":2,"verse":"And he had in his hand a Namely, a special book of the affairs of God's Church: For the book that contains things belonging to the whole world, is said to be kept with the Creator (Rev_5:1) but the book of the Church, with the Redeemer: and out of this book is taken the rest of the history of this Apocalypse. little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and [his] left [foot] on the earth,"},{"number":3,"verse":"And cried with a loude voyce, as when a lyon roareth: and when he had cried, seuen thunders vttered their voyces."},{"number":4,"verse":"A godly care is laudable, but must be married with knowledge. Therefore nothing is to be done but by the calling of God, which must be expected and waited for by the godly. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Keep them secret. Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not."},{"number":5,"verse":"And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth This was a gesture used of one that swears, which men do now use. lifted up his hand to heaven,"},{"number":6,"verse":"And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, Neither time itself, nor the things that are in time: but that the world to come is at hand, which is altogether of eternity, and beyond all times. that there should be There shall never be any more time. time no longer:"},{"number":7,"verse":"But in the days of the See (Rev_11:15; Rev_16:17). voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets."},{"number":8,"verse":"The other part of this chapter concerning the particular calling of John to the receiving of the following prophecy, which is enjoined him, first by sign, in three verses, then in plain words in the last verse (Rev_10:9-11). To the setting forth of the sign belong these things: That John is taught from heaven to ask for the book of the prophecy in this verse: for these motions and desires God inspires that asking for the book, he is charged to take it in a figurative manner, the use of which is expounded in (Rev_10:9) (as in) (Eze_2:9) whence this similitude is borrowed: lastly that John at the commandment of Christ took the book, and found by experience that the same as proceeding from Christ, was most sweet, but in that it foretells the afflictions of the Church, it was most bitter to his spirit. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go [and] take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth."},{"number":9,"verse":"So I went vnto the Angel, and saide to him, Giue me the litle booke; he said vnto me, Take it, and eate it vp, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shalbe in thy mouth as sweete as honie."},{"number":10,"verse":"Then I tooke the litle booke out of ye Angels hand, and ate it vp, and it was in my mouth as sweete as hony: but whe I had eaten it my belly was bitter."},{"number":11,"verse":"A simple and plain declaration of the sign before, witnessing the divine calling of John, and laying on him the necessity of it. And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings."}]}
