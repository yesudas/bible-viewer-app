(The following verses are additions to Brenton's text from the alexandrine codex. Verses after 33 appear only in the Hebrew text. ) (30)Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord God of Israel in mount Gebal, (31)as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it was written in the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, on which iron had not been lifted up: and he offered there whole burnt offerings to the Lord, and a piece offering. And Joshua wrote upon the stones a copy of the law, even the law of Moses, before the children of Israel. (33)And all Israel, and their elders, and their judges, and their scribes, passed on one side and on the other, before the ark; and the priests and the levites took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the stranger and the native were there, who were half of them near mount Gebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded at first, to bless the people."}]}
