(29)They shall take their tents and their sheep, they shall take for themselves their garments, and all their baggage and their camels; and summon you destruction against them from every side. (30)Flee you, dig very deep for a dwelling-place, you that dwell in the palace; for the king of Babylon has framed a counsel, and devised a device against you. (31)Rise up, and go up against a nation settled and dwelling at ease, who have no doors, nor bolts, nor bars, who dwell alone. (32)And their camels shall be a spoil, and the multitude of their cattle shall be destroyed: and I will scatter them as chaff with every wind, having their hair cut about their foreheads, I will bring on their overthrow from all sides, says the Lord. (33)And the palace shall be a resting-place for ostriches, and desolate for ever: no man shall abide there, and no son of man shall dwell there."}]}
