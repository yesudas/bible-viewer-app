(29)In those days they shall certainly not say, The fathers ate a sour grape, and the children's teeth were set on edge. (30)But every one shall die in his own sin; and the teeth of him that eats the sour grape shall be set on edge. (31)Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Juda: (32)not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they abode not in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord. (33)For this is my covenant which I will make with the house of Israel; after those days, says the Lord, I will surely put my laws into their mind, and write them on their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. (34)And they shall not at all teach every one his fellow citizen, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them: for I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more. (35)Thus says the Lord, who gives the sun for a light by day, the moon and the stars for a light by night, and makes a roaring in the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; the Lord Almighty is his name: (36)if these ordinances cease from before me, says the Lord, then shall the family of Israel cease to be a nation before me forever. (37)Though the sky should be raised to a greater height, says the Lord, and though the ground of the earth should be sunk lower beneath, yet I will not cast off the family of Israel, says the Lord, for all that they have done. (38)Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when the city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Anameel to the gate of the corner. (39)And the measurement of it shall proceed in front of them as far as the hills of Gareb, and it shall be compassed with a circular wall of choice stones. (40)And all the Asaremoth even to Nachal Kedron, as far as the corner of the horse-gate eastward, shall be holiness to the Lord; and it shall not fail any more, and shall not be destroyed for ever."}]}
