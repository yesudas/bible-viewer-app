(See Appendix, which has: There are several difficulties connected with this passage. In the first place it seems evident that the LXX. read בסך, and the English translators בסר, or something similar. The Hebrew Text (to which no קרי is appended) thus far favours the LXX.; who, however, appear to have read אררס as a part of ארר, and made an adjective of it. Again, τόπῳ has nothing immediately answering it in the Hebrew, and may be accounted for on the principle so often referred to of double translation.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"Therefore are you very sad, O my soul? and therefore do you trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; he is the salvation of my countenance."},{"number":6,"verse":"O my God, my soul has been troubled within me: therefore will I remember you from the land of Jordan, and of the Ermonites, from the little hill."},{"number":7,"verse":"Deep calls to deep at the voice of your cataracts: all your billows and your waves have gone over me."},{"number":8,"verse":"By day the Lord will command his mercy, and (Heb. and Alex. his song shall be, etc. ) manifest it by night: with me is prayer to the God of my life."},{"number":9,"verse":"I will say to God, You are my helper; why have you forgotten me? therefore do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses me?"},{"number":10,"verse":"While my bones were breaking, they that afflicted me reproached me; while they said to me daily, Where is your God?"},{"number":11,"verse":"Therefore are you very sad, O my soul? and therefore do you trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; he is the health of my countenance, and my God."}]}
