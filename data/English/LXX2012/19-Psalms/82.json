(11)Make their princes as Oreb and Zeb, and Zebee and Salmana; even all their princes: (12)who said, let us take to ourselves the (Alex. sanctuary. ) altar of God as an inheritance. (13)O my God, make them as a wheel; as stubble before the face of the wind. (14)As fire which shall burn up a wood, as the flame may consume the mountains; (15)so shall you persecute them with your tempest, and trouble them in your anger.

(18)And let them know that your name is Lord; that you alone are Most High over all the earth."}]}
