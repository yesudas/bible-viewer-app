Pause. (Psalm 9a (Note. - Here begins a change of numbers as compared with the Heb. which continues to Ps. 146, this psalm having no number, and the eleventh being called the tenth. The following verses 21-37 are numbered 1-18 in the original text. ) ) (21)Why stand you afar off, O Lord? why do you overlook us in times of need, in affliction? (22)While the ungodly one acts proudly, the poor is (Gr. inflamed, as in a fever. ) hotly pursued: the wicked are taken in the crafty counsels which they imagine. (23)Because the sinner praises himself for the desires of his heart; and the unjust one blesses himself. (24)The sinner has provoked the Lord: according to the abundance of his (Or, anger. ) pride he will not seek after him: God is not before him. (25)His ways are (Gr. profaned. ) profane at all times; your judgments are removed from before him: he will gain the mastery over all his enemies. (26)For he has said in his heart, I shall not be moved, continuing without evil from generation to generation. (Rom 8:14/a>. ) (27)Whose mouth is full of cursing, and bitterness, and fraud: under his tongue are trouble and pain. (28)He lies in wait with rich men in secret places, in order to kill the innocent: his eyes are (Gr. look. ) set against the poor. (29)He lies in wait in secret as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to ravish the poor, to ravish the poor when he draws him after him: he will bring him down in his snare. (30)He will bow down and fall when he has mastered the poor. (31)For he has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he has turned away his face so as never to look. (32)Arise, O Lord God; let your hand be lifted up: forget not the poor. (33)Therefore, has the wicked provoked God? for he has said in his heart, He will not require it. (34)You see it; for you do observe trouble and wrath, to deliver them into your hands: the poor has been left to you; you were a helper to the orphan. (35)Break you the arm of the sinner and wicked man: his sin shall be sought for, and shall not be found. (36)The Lord shall reign for ever, even for ever and ever: you Gentiles shall perish out his land. (37)The Lord has heard the desire of the poor: your ear has inclined to the preparation of their heart; (38)to plead for the orphan and afflicted, that man may no more boast upon the earth."}]}
