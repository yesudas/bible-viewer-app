(9)If I should spread my wings to fly (Alex. κατ᾿ ὄρθον, toward the dawn. ) straight forward, and sojourn at the extremity of the sea, it would be vain, (10)for even there your hand would guide me, and your right hand would hold me. (11)When I said, Surely the darkness will cover me; even the night was light in my (Comp. Heb. ) luxury. (12)For darkness will not be darkness with you; but night will be light as day: as its darkness, so shall its light be to you. (13)For you, O Lord, have possessed my reins; you have helped me from my mother's womb. (14)I will give you thanks; for you are fearfully wondrous; wondrous are your works; and my soul knows it well. (15)My bones, which you made in secret were not hidden from you, nor my substance, in the lowest parts of the earth. (16)Your eyes saw my unwrought substance, and all men shall be written in your book; they shall be formed by day, though there should for a time be no one among them. (17)But your friends, O God, have been greatly honored by me; their rule has been greatly strengthened. (18)I will number them, and they shall be multiplied beyond the sand; I awake, and am still with you. (19)Oh that you would kill the wicked, O God; depart from me, you men of blood. (20)For you will say concerning their thought, that they shall take your cities in vain. (21)Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hate you? and wasted away because of your enemies? (22)I have hated them with perfect hatred; they were counted my enemies. (23)Prove me, O God, and know my heart; examine me, and know my paths; (24)and see if there is any way of iniquity in me, and lead me in an everlasting way."}]}
