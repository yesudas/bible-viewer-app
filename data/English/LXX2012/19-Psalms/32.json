(12)Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance. (13)The Lord looks out of heaven; he beholds all the sons of men. (14)He looks from his prepared habitation on all the dwellers on the earth; (15)who fashioned their hearts (Perhaps 'individually.' Vulg. sigillatim. ) alone; who understands all their works. (16)A king is not saved by reason of a great host; and a giant shall not be delivered by the greatness of his strength. (17)A horse is vain for safety; neither shall he be delivered by the greatness of his power. (18)Behold, the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him, those that hope in his mercy; (19)to deliver their souls from death, and to keep them alive in famine. (20)Our soul waits on the Lord; for he is our helper and defender. (21)For our heart shall rejoice in him, and we have hoped in his holy name. (22)Let your mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped in you."}]}
