(4)For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. (5)For I know that the Lord is great, and our Lord is above all gods; (6)all that the Lord willed, he did in heaven, and on the earth, in the sea, and in all deeps. (7)Who brings up clouds from the extremity of the earth: he has made lightnings for the rain: he brings winds out of his treasures. (8)Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. (9)He sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, O Egypt, on Pharao, and on all his servants. (10)Who struck many nations, and killed mighty kings; (11)Seon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Basan, and all the kingdoms of Chanaan: (12)and gave their land for an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel his people. (13)O Lord, your name endures for ever, and your memorial to all generations. (14)For the Lord shall judge his people, and comfort himself concerning his servants. (15)The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the works of men's hands. (16)They have a mouth, but they can’t speak; they have eyes, but they can’t see; (17)they have ears, but they can’t hear; for there is no breath in their mouth. (18)Let those who make them be made like to them; and all those who trust in them. (19)O house of Israel, bless you the Lord: O house of Aaron, bless you the Lord: (20)O house of Levi, bless you the Lord: you that fear the Lord, bless the Lord. (21)Blessed in Sion be the Lord, who dwells in Jerusalem."}]}
