(13)For I heard the slander of many that lived round about: when they were gathered together against me, they took counsel to take my life. (14)But I hoped in you, O Lord: I said, You are my God. (15)My lots are in your hands: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, (16)and from them that persecute me. Make your face to shine upon your servant: save me in your mercy. (17)O Lord, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon you: let the ungodly be ashamed, and brought down to Hades. (18)Let the deceitful lips become dumb, which speak iniquity against the righteous with pride and scorn. (19)How abundant is the multitude of your goodness, O Lord, which you have laid up for them that fear you! you have wrought it out for them that hope on you, in the presence of the sons of men. (20)You will hide them in the secret of your presence from the vexation of man: you will screen them in a tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues. (21)Blessed be the Lord: for he has magnified his mercy in a fortified city. (22)But I said in my extreme fear, I am cast out from the sight of your eyes: therefore you did listen, O Lord, to the voice of my supplication when I cried to you. (23)Love the Lord, all you his saints: for the Lord seeks for truth, and renders a reward to them that deal very proudly. (24)Be of good courage, and let your heart be strengthened, all you that hope in the Lord."}]}
