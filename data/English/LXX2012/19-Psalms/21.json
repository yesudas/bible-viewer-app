(14)I am poured out like water, and all my bones are loosened: my heart in the midst of my belly is become like melting wax. (15)My strength is dried up, like a potsherd; and my tongue is glued to my throat; and you have brought me down to the dust of death. (16)For many dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked doers has beset me round: they pierced my hands and my feet. (17)They counted all my bones; and they observed and looked upon me. (18) (Mat 27:35. ) They parted my garments among themselves, and cast lots upon my raiment. (19)But you, O Lord, remove not my help afar off: be ready for mine aid. (20)Deliver my soul from the sword; my only-begotten one from the power of the dog. (21)Save me from the lion's mouth; and regard my (See Hebrew. ) lowliness from the horns of the unicorns. (22)I will declare your name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I sing praise to you. (23)You that fear the Lord, praise him; all you seed of Jacob, glorify him: let all the seed of Israel fear him. (24)For he has not despised nor been angry at the supplication of the poor; nor turned away his face from me; but when I cried to him, he heard me. (25)My praise is of you in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. (26)The poor shall eat and be satisfied; and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: their heart shall live for ever. (27)All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord: and all the kindred of the nations shall worship before him. (28)For the kingdom is the Lord's; and he is the governor of the nations. (29)All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and worshipped: all that go down to the earth shall fall down before him: my soul also lives to him. (30)And my seed shall serve him: the generation that is coming shall be reported to the Lord. (31)And they shall report his righteousness to the people that shall be born, whom the Lord has made."}]}
