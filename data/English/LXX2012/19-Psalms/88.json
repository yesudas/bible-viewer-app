(19)Then you spoke in vision to your children, and said, I have laid help on a mighty one; I have exalted one chosen out of my people. (20) (Act 13:22/a>. ) I have found David my servant; I have anointed him by my holy (Heb. and Alex. oil, see Ps. 91. (92) 10. ) mercy. (21)For my hand shall support him; and mine arm shall strengthen him. (22)The enemy shall have no advantage against him; and the son of transgression shall not hurt him again. (23)And I will hew down his foes before him, and put to flight those that hate him. (24)But my truth and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted. (25)And I will set his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. (26)He shall call upon me, saying, You are my Father, my God, and the helper of my salvation. (27)And I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth. (28)I will keep my mercy for him for ever, and my covenant shall be firm with him. (29)And I will establish his seed for ever and ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. (30)If his children should forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; (31)if they should profane my ordinances, and not keep my commandments; (32)I will visit their transgressions with a rod, and their sins with scourges. (33)But my mercy I will not utterly remove from him, nor wrong my truth. (34)Neither will I by any means profane my covenant; and I will not make void the things that proceed out of my lips. (35)Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie to David. (36)His see shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me; (37)and as the moon that is established for ever, and as the faithful witness in heaven. Pause. (38)But you have cast off and set at nothing, you has rejected your anointed. (39)You have overthrown the covenant of your servant; you has profaned his sanctuary, casting it to the ground. (40)You have broken down all his hedges; you have made his strong holds a terror. (41)All that go by the way have spoiled him: he is become a reproach to his neighbors. (42)You have exalted the right hand of his enemies; you have made all his enemies to rejoice. (43)You have turned back the help of his sword, and have not helped him in the battle. (44)You have deprived him of (Gr. purification. ) glory: you have broken down his throne to the ground. (45)You have shortened the days of his (Alex. time. ) throne: you have poured shame upon him. Pause. (46)How long, O Lord, will you turn away, for ever? shall your anger flame out as fire? (47)Remember what my being is: for have you created all the sons of men in vain? (48)What man is there who shall live, and not see death? shall any one deliver his soul from the hand of Hades? Pause. (49)Where are your ancient mercies, O Lord, which you sware to David in your truth? (50)Remember, O Lord, the reproach of your servants, which I have borne in my bosom, even the reproach of many nations; (51)wherewith your enemies have reviled, O Lord: wherewith they have reviled the recompense of your anointed. (52)Blessed be the Lord for ever. So be it, so be it."}]}
