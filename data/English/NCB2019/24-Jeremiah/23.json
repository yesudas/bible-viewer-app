Therefore, I will not hesitate to punish you for your evil deeds, says the LORD."},{"number":3,"verse":"I myself will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their meadows where they will be fruitful and multiply."},{"number":4,"verse":"I will appoint shepherds for them who will treat them kindly, so that they will no longer fear or experience terror, nor will any be discovered missing, says the LORD."},{"number":5,"verse":"Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up a righteous branch from the line of David. He will reign as king and rule wisely and ensure justice and righteousness in the land."},{"number":6,"verse":"In his days Judah will live in safety, and Israel will dwell in security. And this is the name that will be given to him: “The LORD Our Righteousness.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"Therefore, the days are coming, says the LORD, when people will no longer say, “As the LORD lives who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt,”"},{"number":8,"verse":"but rather, “As the LORD lives who brought forth the offspring of the house of Israel up from the land of the north and out of all the lands where he had dispersed them.” Then they will again inhabit their own land."},{"number":9,"verse":"As for the prophets, my heart is broken within me, and all my bones never cease to tremble.

For I will inflict disaster upon them in the year of their punishment, says the LORD."},{"number":13,"verse":"Among the prophets of Samaria I beheld this repulsive deed: they prophesied in the name of Baal and led my people astray."},{"number":14,"verse":"But among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen deeds that are even more shocking: they commit adultery and persist in lying and uphold those who are evil so that no one turns away from wickedness. To me they have all become like Sodom, and its inhabitants are like Gomorrah."},{"number":15,"verse":"Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts in regard to the prophets: I intend to give them wormwood to eat and force them to drink poisoned water. For from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land."},{"number":16,"verse":"Thus says the LORD of hosts: Do not listen to the words of the prophets; their prophecies are designed to delude you. They concoct visions from their own minds and not from the mouth of the LORD."},{"number":17,"verse":"To those who despise the word of the LORD they say, “Peace will be yours.” To those who follow their own stubborn inclinations they say, “No harm will befall you.”"},{"number":18,"verse":"Yet which of them has stood in the council of the LORD to see or to hear his word?

What does straw have in common with wheat? asks the LORD."},{"number":29,"verse":"Is not my word like fire, says the LORD, like a hammer shattering a rock?"},{"number":30,"verse":"Therefore, says the LORD, I have set myself in opposition to the prophets who steal my words from one another."},{"number":31,"verse":"I am against those prophets who concoct their own prophecies and then assert, “Thus says the LORD.”"},{"number":32,"verse":"I am against those prophets who prophesy lying dreams, says the LORD, and then recount them, thereby leading my people astray with their lies and reckless bragging. They have not received any commission from me, and so they are of no benefit to this people in any way, says the LORD."},{"number":33,"verse":"And when this people or a prophet or a priest asks you, “What is the burden of the LORD?” you are to reply, “You are the burden, and I will cast you off,” says the LORD."},{"number":34,"verse":"If a prophet or a priest or anyone else speaks of “the burden of the LORD,” I will punish that man and his household."},{"number":35,"verse":"Therefore, when speaking to one another, you are to ask, “What answer did the LORD give?” or “What did the LORD say?”"},{"number":36,"verse":"But you must never again speak of “the burden of the LORD,” because each man’s word becomes his own burden, and you therefore pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God."},{"number":37,"verse":"Therefore, you are to ask a prophet, “What answer has the LORD given?” or “What has the LORD said?”"},{"number":38,"verse":"But if you say “the burden of the LORD,” the LORD will reply, “Because you have used the words ‘the burden of the LORD’ when I forbade you to use that expression,"},{"number":39,"verse":"therefore, I will lift you up and cast you away from my presence, both you and the city that I gave to you and your ancestors."},{"number":40,"verse":"And I will inflict upon you everlasting disgrace and eternal and unforgettable shame.”"}]}
