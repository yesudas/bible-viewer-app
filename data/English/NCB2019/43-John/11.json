It was a cave, with a stone closing the entrance."},{"number":39,"verse":"Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the dead man’s sister, said to him, “Lord, by now there will be a stench, for he has been dead for four days.”"},{"number":40,"verse":"Jesus replied, “Did I not tell you that if you have faith you will see the glory of God?”"},{"number":41,"verse":"And so they removed the stone.
