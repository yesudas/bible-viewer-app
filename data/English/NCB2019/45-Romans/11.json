I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."},{"number":2,"verse":"God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. You surely must know what Scripture asserts in the passage about Elijah where he pleads with God against Israel:"},{"number":3,"verse":"“Lord, they have killed your Prophets, they have torn down your altars. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"What was God’s response to him? “I have spared for myself seven thousand men who have not knelt before Baal.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"So too, at the present time, there is a remnant, chosen by grace."},{"number":6,"verse":"But if it is by grace, then it is no longer by works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace."},{"number":7,"verse":"What follows, then? Israel was unable to attain what it was seeking. The elect attained it, but the rest were hardened,"},{"number":8,"verse":"as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of lethargy: eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, down to this very day.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"And David says: “Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them."},{"number":10,"verse":"Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.”"},{"number":11,"verse":"And so I ask: Have they stumbled so that they might fall? By no means! However, through their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, and this has stirred them to envy."},{"number":12,"verse":"Now if their transgression results in riches for the world, and their loss results in riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full participation bring!"},{"number":13,"verse":"Now I am addressing you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I glory in my ministry"},{"number":14,"verse":"in the hope that it will arouse the jealousy of those who are of my flesh so that some might be saved."},{"number":15,"verse":"For if their rejection leads to the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?"},{"number":16,"verse":"If the firstfruits are holy, then so is the whole lump of dough.

If you start to boast, remember that it is not you who support the root but the root that supports you."},{"number":19,"verse":"You will assert, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”"},{"number":20,"verse":"That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you hold your place only because of your faith. Therefore, do not rise up in pride but be filled with awe."},{"number":21,"verse":"For if God did not spare the natural branches, he might not spare you either."},{"number":22,"verse":"Therefore, keep in mind the kindness and the severity of God: his severity toward those who fell, but his kindness to you provided that you remain deserving of that kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off,"},{"number":23,"verse":"while those who do not persist in their unbelief will be grafted in, since God has the power to do so again."},{"number":24,"verse":"For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated one, how much more easily will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree."},{"number":25,"verse":"I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brethren, lest you think yourselves too wise: this hardening that has afflicted Israel will continue only until the full number of the Gentiles has come in."},{"number":26,"verse":"This is how all Israel will be saved, as it is written, “The Deliverer will come out of Zion; he will banish godlessness from Jacob"},{"number":27,"verse":"And this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins.”"},{"number":28,"verse":"As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake.
