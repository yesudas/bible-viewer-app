Or what is the value of circumcision?"},{"number":2,"verse":"A great deal in every respect. In the first place, they were entrusted with the words of God."},{"number":3,"verse":"What if some were unfaithful? Will their lack of faith nullify the fidelity of God?"},{"number":4,"verse":"By no means! God must be true even if every human being is a liar,[a] as it is written, “That you may be justified in your words, and vindicated when you are judged.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"But if our wickedness serves to confirm the righteousness of God, what are we to say? Is God unjust (I speak of him in human terms) to bring retribution upon us?"},{"number":6,"verse":"Of course not! For that would imply that God could not judge the world."},{"number":7,"verse":"But if, as a result of my falsehood, God demonstrates his truthfulness, to his greater glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?"},{"number":8,"verse":"And why not say, as some people slanderously accuse us of proposing, “Let us do evil so that good may result”?
