Do you wish to be free of fear from someone in authority? Then continue to do what is right and you will receive his approval."},{"number":4,"verse":"For he is acting as God’s representative for your welfare. But if you do what is evil, then be afraid for he does not wear a sword for nothing.

Let us therefore cast aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light."},{"number":13,"verse":"Let us behave honorably as in the day: not in orgies and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy."},{"number":14,"verse":"Rather, put on the Lord Jesus Christ and allow no opportunity for the flesh to gratify its sinful desires."}]}
