Weeds will swallow up their treasures of silver, and thorns will overrun their tents."},{"number":7,"verse":"The days of punishment have come; the days of retribution are here. Israel cries out, “The prophet is a fool, the inspired man is a maniac.” Because your iniquity is great, all the greater is your hostility."},{"number":8,"verse":"The prophet has been appointed by God to serve as a watchman over Ephraim.

Woe to them when I turn away from them!"},{"number":13,"verse":"Ephraim once seemed to me like Tyre, planted in a beautiful meadow. But now Ephraim will be required to lead out his children for slaughter."},{"number":14,"verse":"Give them, O LORD— what will you give? Give them wombs that miscarry[g] and dried-up breasts."},{"number":15,"verse":"All of their wickedness had its root in Gilgal;[h] it was there that I came to hate them. Because of their evil deeds, I will drive them out of my house. I will no longer love them; all of their rulers are rebels."},{"number":16,"verse":"Ephraim is stricken; their root is withered, and they yield no fruit. Even if they bring forth children, I will slay the cherished offspring of their womb."},{"number":17,"verse":"My God will cast them off because they have not listened to him; they will become wanderers among the nations."}]}
