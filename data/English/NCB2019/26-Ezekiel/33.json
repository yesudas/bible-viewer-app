But if they had heeded the warning, they would have saved their lives."},{"number":6,"verse":"However, if the watchman sees the sword coming and fails to blow the trumpet to warn the people, and the sword then comes and slays anyone, I will hold the watchman responsible for that person’s death."},{"number":7,"verse":"I have appointed you, son of man, as a watchman for the house of Israel. Therefore, whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you must pass along my warning to them."},{"number":8,"verse":"If I say to the wicked person, “You shall surely die,” and you do not speak up to warn that person to renounce his evil ways, he will die because of his guilt, but I will hold you responsible for his death."},{"number":9,"verse":"However, if you warn a wicked person to renounce his ways and repent, and he fails to do so, then he will die for his guilt, but you will have saved your life."},{"number":10,"verse":"Son of man, say to the house of Israel: You continually complain, “Our crimes and our sins weigh heavily upon us, and we are wasting away because of them. How are we to go on living?”"},{"number":11,"verse":"Say to them: As I live, says the Lord GOD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather in their decision to turn from their evil ways and live.

Therefore, my mouth was opened, and I was no longer unable to speak."},{"number":23,"verse":"This word of the LORD then came to me:"},{"number":24,"verse":"Son of man, those people who live in the ruins of the land of Israel say repeatedly, “Even though he was merely one person, Abraham received possession of this country. But we are many in number. Surely the land has been given to us as our possession.”"},{"number":25,"verse":"Tell them this in response: Thus says the Lord GOD: You consume meat with the blood still in it, you raise your eyes to worship idols, and you shed blood. Should you then be permitted to possess the land?"},{"number":26,"verse":"You rely on your swords, you engage in abominable practices, and each of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. Should you then be permitted to possess the land?"},{"number":27,"verse":"Give them this message: Thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, I swear that those who dwell in the ruins shall fall by the sword, those who live in the countryside I will give to the wild animals to be devoured, and those who inhabit dens and caves will die of the plague."},{"number":28,"verse":"I will make the land a desolate waste, and its proud strength will come to an end.

They sit down in front of you and listen to your words, but they refuse to obey them. They flatter you with their lips, but their hearts are only interested in dishonest gain."},{"number":32,"verse":"To them you are like a singer of lovely songs with a beautiful voice and skill in playing a musical instrument. They listen to your words, but they refuse to obey them."},{"number":33,"verse":"But when all this comes to pass—and that moment is soon approaching—they will know that a prophet has been in their midst."}]}
