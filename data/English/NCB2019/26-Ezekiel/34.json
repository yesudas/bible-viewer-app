Prophesy and say to them: Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to you shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to them: Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves. Should not shepherds rather feed their flock?"},{"number":3,"verse":"You have fed on their milk, you have clothed yourselves with their wool, and you have slaughtered the fatlings, but you have not fed the sheep."},{"number":4,"verse":"You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, and you have not bandaged those who were injured. Nor have you bothered to bring back those who strayed or searched for the lost. On the contrary, you have ruled them with cruelty and harshness."},{"number":5,"verse":"Therefore, they were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and thus they became the prey of all the wild beasts."},{"number":6,"verse":"My sheep were scattered, wandering aimlessly over all the mountains and on every high hill. My flock has been scattered over the entire world, with no one to inquire about them or search for them."},{"number":7,"verse":"Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:"},{"number":8,"verse":"As I live, says the Lord GOD, because my sheep are without a shepherd and thus have been ravaged and have become food for all the wild animals, and because my shepherds have not gone forth in search of my sheep, but have fed themselves and not been concerned about feeding my sheep,"},{"number":9,"verse":"therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD."},{"number":10,"verse":"Thus says the Lord GOD: I intend to punish the shepherds.

I will retrieve them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and darkness."},{"number":13,"verse":"I will bring them back from among the peoples and gather them from foreign lands, I will lead them back to their own land and pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the inhabited areas of the country."},{"number":14,"verse":"I will feed them in fertile pastures, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing grounds.

I will shepherd my flock with justice."},{"number":17,"verse":"[d]As for you, my flock, the Lord GOD says this: I will judge between one sheep and another, between rams and goats."},{"number":18,"verse":"Is it not sufficient for you to graze on the best pasture land? Must you also trample with your feet on the rest of the pastures? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also foul the rest with your feet?"},{"number":19,"verse":"As a result, my sheep must graze on what you have trampled underfoot and drink what you have befouled with your feet."},{"number":20,"verse":"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep."},{"number":21,"verse":"Because you have shoved with flank and shoulder and butted all the weak sheep with your horns until you have scattered them in every direction,"},{"number":22,"verse":"I will save my flock, and they will never again be treated unfairly. I will judge between one sheep and another."},{"number":23,"verse":"[e]I will raise up one shepherd, my servant David, to care for them.
