He had a linen cord[b] and a measuring rod in his hand, and he was standing in the gateway."},{"number":4,"verse":"The man said to me, “Son of man, look carefully and listen attentively, and pay close attention to all that I will show you. That is the reason why you were brought here. Report to the house of Israel everything that you see.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"Then I beheld an outer wall that surrounded the temple on all sides. The length of the measuring rod that the man was holding was six cubits long, each cubit[c] being a cubit and a handbreadth in length. He measured the thickness and the height of the wall; each was one rod."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then he went to the gate which faced eastward, mounted its steps, and measured the gate’s threshold; it was one rod deep."},{"number":7,"verse":"Each cell was one rod long and one rod wide, and the walls between the cells measured five cubits. The threshold of the gate adjoining the vestibule of the gate at the inner end measured one rod."},{"number":8,"verse":"Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway,"},{"number":9,"verse":"which was eight cubits, and its pilasters, which were two cubits.
