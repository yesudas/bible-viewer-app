Whenever she went up to the house of the LORD, she provoked her. This made her weep, and she refused to eat."},{"number":8,"verse":"Elkanah, her husband, said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why are you not eating? Why are you so downhearted? Am I not worth more than ten sons to you?”"},{"number":9,"verse":"Once, when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up.
