{"bibleAbbr":"NCB2019","bookName":"Galatians","bookEnglishName":"Galatians","chapterNumber":3,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly presented as crucified."},{"number":2,"verse":"I only wish you to tell me this: Did you receive the Spirit by observing the Law or by believing what you heard?"},{"number":3,"verse":"How can you be so foolish? After having begun with the Spirit, are you now ending in the flesh?"},{"number":4,"verse":"Is everything you have suffered to result in absolutely nothing—if indeed it was for nothing?"},{"number":5,"verse":"Does God give you the Spirit and work mighty deeds among you because you have kept the Law or because you believed what you have heard? The Blessing of Abraham. [a]"},{"number":6,"verse":"Thus Abraham believed in God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."},{"number":7,"verse":"You can be assured that those who have faith are children of Abraham."},{"number":8,"verse":"Because Scripture foresaw[b] that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, it declared the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"For this reason, those who have faith share the blessing with Abraham, the faithful one."},{"number":10,"verse":"In contrast, those who rely on the works of the Law are under a curse, for it is written “Cursed is everyone who does not persevere in doing all the things that are written in the book of the Law.”"},{"number":11,"verse":"Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the Law, for the one who is righteous will live by faith."},{"number":12,"verse":"However, the Law is not based on faith. On the contrary, whoever does these things shall live by them."},{"number":13,"verse":"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse himself for us, as it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hung upon a tree.”"},{"number":14,"verse":"This is so that the blessing bestowed upon Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through Jesus Christ so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."},{"number":15,"verse":"Brethren, allow me to give you an everyday example. Once a human will has been ratified, no one can make further additions to it or set it aside."},{"number":16,"verse":"Now the promises were made to Abraham and his descendant. It does not say “and to your descendants,” as referring to many, but it says “and to your descendant,” that is, to one person, who is Christ."},{"number":17,"verse":"This is what I am saying: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, cannot invalidate a covenant that had been previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise."},{"number":18,"verse":"Obviously, if the inheritance comes from the Law, it no longer comes from the promise. However, God bestowed it on Abraham through a promise."},{"number":19,"verse":"Why then? It was added because of transgressions[c] until the descendant appeared to whom the promise had been made, and it was promulgated by angels through an intermediary."},{"number":20,"verse":"Now an intermediary is not necessary when there is only one party, and God is one."},{"number":21,"verse":"Is the Law then opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! If the Law that had been given had the power to bestow life, then righteousness would have come through the Law."},{"number":22,"verse":"But according to Scripture all things have been confined under sin, so that through faith in Jesus Christ what was promised might be given to those who believe."},{"number":23,"verse":"[d]Now before faith came, we were prisoners of the Law, confined as we waited for the faith that would eventually be revealed."},{"number":24,"verse":"Therefore, the Law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, so that we might be justified by faith."},{"number":25,"verse":"However, now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor."},{"number":26,"verse":"Through faith you are all children of God in Christ Jesus."},{"number":27,"verse":"For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves in Christ."},{"number":28,"verse":"There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free man, there is no longer male or female. For all of you are one in Christ Jesus."},{"number":29,"verse":"And if you are Christ’s, then you are the offspring of Abraham and heirs according to the promise."}]}
