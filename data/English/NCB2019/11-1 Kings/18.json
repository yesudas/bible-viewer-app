Call upon the name of your gods, but do not set it on fire.”"},{"number":26,"verse":"They took the ox that had been given them, and they prepared it. They called upon the name of Baal from the morning until noontime. They said, “Hear us, O Baal.” But there was no voice, and no one answered. They then leapt around on the altar they had built."},{"number":27,"verse":"At noon, Elijah mocked them and said, “Cry out loud, for he is a god. He might be meditating, or maybe he has gone aside.

Ahab rode off and went to Jezreel."},{"number":46,"verse":"The hand of the LORD was upon Elijah, and he girded up his loins[c] and ran in front of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel."}]}
