However, I refrain from doing so in order that no one may regard me more highly than would be evident from what he has seen in me and heard from me."},{"number":7,"verse":"Therefore, to keep me from becoming unduly elated by the wondrous nature of these revelations, I was given a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to beat me and prevent me from becoming unduly elated."},{"number":8,"verse":"Three times I begged the Lord to have it leave me,"},{"number":9,"verse":"but he answered me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” Hence, I will boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell within me."},{"number":10,"verse":"For this reason, I rejoice when I endure weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and distress for the sake of Christ.
