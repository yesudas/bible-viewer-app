He saw a prostitute there, and he had sex with her."},{"number":2,"verse":"The people in Gaza were told, “Samson is here.” They surrounded the place where he was staying, and they lay in wait for him all night at the city gate.

Her name was Delilah."},{"number":5,"verse":"The lords of the Philistines visited her and said, “Entice him and see if you can find out the source of his great strength and how we can overpower him and tie him up and subdue him.

I beg you, please strengthen me[c] this one more time so that I might take vengeance upon the Philistines for my two eyes.”"},{"number":29,"verse":"Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the temple was set.
