{"bibleAbbr":"NCB2019","bookName":"1 Corinthians","bookEnglishName":"1 Corinthians","chapterNumber":14,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"Make love your aim, but strive earnestly after the spiritual gifts, especially for that of prophecy."},{"number":2,"verse":"If anyone speaks in tongues, he is speaking not to men but to God, and no one understands him, for he is speaking mysteries in the Spirit."},{"number":3,"verse":"On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to men for their building up, their encouragement, and their consolation."},{"number":4,"verse":"Whoever speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but whoever prophesies builds up the Church."},{"number":5,"verse":"I wish that all of you could speak in tongues, but I would much prefer that you could prophesy. For the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless the latter can interpret what he is saying so that the Church may be built up."},{"number":6,"verse":"Now suppose, brethren, that I should come to you and speak in tongues. Of what value would I be to you if you were unable to discern from my words any revelation or knowledge or prophecy or instruction?"},{"number":7,"verse":"Even inanimate things produce sound, such as a flute or a harp. If they do not produce distinct notes, how can anyone tell what tune is being played?"},{"number":8,"verse":"Or again, if the bugle call is unclear, who will get ready for battle?"},{"number":9,"verse":"Similarly, if you speak in tongues and your speech is unintelligible, how will anyone be able to understand what you are saying? For you will be talking to empty air."},{"number":10,"verse":"There are many different languages that are used in the world, and none of them is without meaning."},{"number":11,"verse":"But if I do not comprehend the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and he will be a foreigner to me."},{"number":12,"verse":"Since you are eager to acquire spiritual gifts, try to excel in those that build up the Church."},{"number":13,"verse":"Therefore, anyone who speaks in tongues should pray for the ability to interpret."},{"number":14,"verse":"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit is at prayer but my mind derives no benefit."},{"number":15,"verse":"What then should I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind."},{"number":16,"verse":"If you are praising only with the spirit, how will the uninstructed person who is present be able to answer “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not comprehend what you are saying?"},{"number":17,"verse":"Your thanksgiving may be inspiring, but the other person has not been edified."},{"number":18,"verse":"I thank God that I speak in tongues more than any of you,"},{"number":19,"verse":"but when I am in the church I would prefer to speak five intelligible words to instruct others rather than ten thousand words in a tongue."},{"number":20,"verse":"Brethren, do not be childish in your thinking. Be like infants in regard to evil, but in your thinking be mature."},{"number":21,"verse":"In the Law[b] it is written, “By people speaking strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, and even so they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”"},{"number":22,"verse":"Clearly, then, tongues are intended as a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is designed not for unbelievers but for believers."},{"number":23,"verse":"Therefore, if the whole Church has assembled and everyone is speaking in tongues, would not any uninstructed person or any unbeliever on entering conclude that you are all out of your minds?"},{"number":24,"verse":"However, if everyone is prophesying and an unbeliever or uninstructed person should enter, he would be reproved by all and judged by all,"},{"number":25,"verse":"and the secrets of his heart would be revealed. Then he would fall down and worship God, declaring, “God is truly in your midst.”"},{"number":26,"verse":"And so, what then should be done, brethren? When you assemble, each of you should bring a psalm or some lesson or a revelation, or speak in a tongue, or offer an interpretation. Everything should be done with the goal in mind of building up."},{"number":27,"verse":"If any of you speak in a tongue, let only two or at most three come forward, one at a time, and someone must interpret."},{"number":28,"verse":"If no one is available to interpret, let those who speak in tongues be silent in the church and speak only to themselves and to God."},{"number":29,"verse":"As for the prophets, let two or three speak, and let the rest weigh their words."},{"number":30,"verse":"Should a revelation be made to someone else who is sitting there, let the one who is speaking stop."},{"number":31,"verse":"You can all prophesy, but one at a time, so that all may receive instruction and encouragement."},{"number":32,"verse":"Indeed, the spirits of the prophets are subject to their prophets’ control,"},{"number":33,"verse":"for God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the Churches of the saints,"},{"number":34,"verse":"[c]women are to keep silent at the assemblies. For they are not permitted to speak, since the Law asserts that they are to be subordinate."},{"number":35,"verse":"If there is anything they wish to know, they should ask their husbands at home. It is improper for them to speak in the church."},{"number":36,"verse":"Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones to whom it has come?"},{"number":37,"verse":"Anyone who claims to be a prophet or to have spiritual powers must recognize that what I am writing to you is a commandment of the Lord."},{"number":38,"verse":"Anyone who does not acknowledge this should be ignored."},{"number":39,"verse":"Therefore, brethren, be eager to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues."},{"number":40,"verse":"But ensure that everything is done properly and in an orderly fashion."}]}
