Who plants a vineyard without eating its fruit? Or who tends a flock without consuming some of its milk?"},{"number":8,"verse":"I am not saying this based simply on human authority, for the Law says the very same thing."},{"number":9,"verse":"In the Law of Moses it is written, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned,"},{"number":10,"verse":"or does he not rather say this for our sake? Without question it was written for our sake, for whoever plows should plow in hope and whoever threshes should thresh in hope, both in expectation of a share in the crop."},{"number":11,"verse":"If we have sown a spiritual crop for you, is it unreasonable for us to expect from you a material harvest?"},{"number":12,"verse":"If others have this claim on you, do not we?

No one shall deprive me of this boast!"},{"number":16,"verse":"If I proclaim the gospel, that is no reason for me to boast, for the obligation to do so has been given to me, and woe to me if I fail to fulfill it."},{"number":17,"verse":"If I proclaimed the gospel of my own volition, I would deserve a reward; but if I do not do so voluntarily, I am simply discharging the commission that has been given to me."},{"number":18,"verse":"What then is my reward? It is simply that in my preaching I may offer the gospel free of charge and not make use of the rights that the gospel affords me."},{"number":19,"verse":"Although I am free and belong to no man, I have made myself a slave to all so as to win over as many as possible."},{"number":20,"verse":"To the Jews, I became like a Jew in order to win the Jews.
