Indeed, even now you are still not ready to receive it,"},{"number":3,"verse":"for you are still of the flesh. As long as jealousy and rivalry continue among you, are you not of the flesh and acting as mere mortals?"},{"number":4,"verse":"Whenever someone says, “I belong to Paul,” and another asserts, “I belong to Apollos,” are you not acting in a merely human fashion?"},{"number":5,"verse":"What then is Apollos? What is Paul? We are only servants through whom you have come to believe, as the Lord assigned each to accomplish."},{"number":6,"verse":"I planted the seed, and Apollos watered it, but God caused it to grow."},{"number":7,"verse":"Therefore, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is of any importance but only God who causes the growth."},{"number":8,"verse":"The one who plants and the one who waters have a common end, and each will be rewarded in accordance with his labor."},{"number":9,"verse":"For we are God’s coworkers; you are God’s field, God’s building."},{"number":10,"verse":"By the grace that God has given to me, I laid a foundation like a skilled master builder, and someone else is building on that foundation.
