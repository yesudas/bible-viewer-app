Chapter E A Copy of the Edict.[b] 1 This is a copy of the edict: “King Ahasuerus the Great to the governors of the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces extending from India to Ethiopia, and to all our loyal subjects: Greetings! 2 “Many people who have been the recipients of ever-increasing honors through the bountiful kindness of their benefactors tend to grow ever more arrogant. 3 Not only do they plot to injure our subjects but, as their power tends to increase their insolent behavior, they even begin to scheme against their very benefactors. 4 Not only do they make it impossible for others to experience gratitude, but they are so inundated in their own arrogance that the concept of goodness has become meaningless to them, and they even believe that they will escape the all-seeing God and his justice, which hates evil. 5 “In addition, it often happens that the deceitful schemes of friends who have been entrusted with the administration of public affairs 6 influence their benefactors to become unwitting accomplices of theirs in the shedding of innocent blood. Thus, the sincere desire of rulers to achieve only the good of their subjects is thwarted by deceitful trickery. 7 History is replete with stories of such evil, but never more so than at the present when we examine the evil wrought in our midst through the criminal deeds of those officials who disgraced their office of authority by their wicked conduct. 8 From this moment on we shall direct all of our efforts to ensure the peace and tranquillity of all our subjects in the kingdom, 9 revising our policies as necessary and giving equitable treatment in adjudicating matters that are brought before us. 10 “In this regard, Haman, son of Hammedatha, a Macedonian[c] without a trace of Persian blood or of the kindness that is part of our heritage, was the recipient of our hospitality. He so completely enjoyed the goodwill that we extend to all nations that we regarded him as our father before whom all should bow down, and we proclaimed him to rank second in line to the royal throne."},{"number":12,"verse":"However, unworthy of this dignity, Haman with unrestrained arrogance undertook to deprive us of our kingdom and our life."},{"number":13,"verse":"By acts of deceit he insisted that it was essential for us to order the destruction of Mordecai, our savior and constant benefactor, and of Esther, our innocent royal consort, together with their whole race."},{"number":14,"verse":"By such measures he sought to render us vulnerable and to transfer the sovereignty now enjoyed by the Persians to the Macedonians."},{"number":15,"verse":"“However, we have determined that the Jews, who were marked for extermination by this thrice-wicked man, are no evildoers. On the contrary, they are governed by the most righteous laws"},{"number":16,"verse":"and are children of the Most High, the living God of sovereign majesty who has ensured for us as well as for our ancestors the continuing prosperity of our kingdom."},{"number":17,"verse":"“Therefore, I command you to ignore the letters sent by Haman, son of Hammedatha,"}]}
