Chapter C The Prayer of Mordecai. 1 [c]Calling to mind everything that the LORD had done, Mordecai prayed to him in these words: 2 “O LORD God, King and ruler of all things, the entire universe is subject to your power, and no one can thwart you in your intention to save Israel. 3 You made heaven and earth and every wonderful thing under the firmament. 4 You are LORD of all, and there is no one, O LORD, who can resist you. 5 Since you know all things, O LORD, you realize that it was not because of insolence or pride or a desire for glory that I so acted in refusing to bow down to this haughty Haman. 6 To ensure the salvation of Israel, I would gladly have kissed the soles of his feet. 7 But I acted in this way so as not to place human glory above the glory of God. I will not bow down to anyone but you, my LORD, and I will not act in this way out of pride. 8 “Now, LORD, my God and King, O God of Abraham, spare your people, for our enemies are determined to exterminate us and to destroy the inheritance that has been yours from times of old. 9 Do not forsake your people whom you redeemed and brought out of Egypt for yourself. 10 Hear my prayer and have mercy on your heritage. Turn our sorrow into joy so that we may live to sing praise to your name, O LORD. Do not silence the lips of those who praise you.” 11 And all the Israelites also cried aloud with all their strength, since death was before their eyes. The Prayer of Esther. 12 Queen Esther, too, was seized with great anguish and sought recourse from the LORD. 13 Removing her splendid robes, she put on garments of sadness and mourning. Instead of rich perfumes, she covered her head with dirt and ashes. She greatly mortified her body, and every part that she used to adorn elegantly, she now covered with her disheveled hair. 14 Then Esther prayed to the LORD, the God of Israel, and said: “O my LORD, you alone are our King. Come to my assistance, for I am alone and have no one to help me but you. 15 My life is in great danger. 16 From my earliest days I was taught by my family that you, O LORD, chose Israel out of all the nations and our fathers from among all their forebearers, as an everlasting heritage, and that you have fulfilled all the promises you made to them. But now we have sinned against you, and you have handed us over to our enemies"}]}
