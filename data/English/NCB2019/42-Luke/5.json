Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat."},{"number":4,"verse":"When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water and let down your nets for a catch.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"Simon answered, “Master, we worked hard throughout the night and caught nothing; but if you say so, I will let down the nets.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"When they had done this, they caught such a great number of fish that their nets were beginning to tear."},{"number":7,"verse":"Therefore, they signaled to their companions in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats to the point that they were in danger of sinking."},{"number":8,"verse":"When Simon Peter saw what had happened, he fell at the knees of Jesus, saying, “Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"For he and all of his companions were amazed at the catch they had made."},{"number":10,"verse":"So too were Simon’s partners James and John, the sons of Zebedee.

If he does, the new cloak will be torn, and the piece from it will not match that of the old."},{"number":37,"verse":"Nor does anyone pour new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and spill out, and the skins will be destroyed."},{"number":38,"verse":"Rather new wine must be put into fresh wineskins."},{"number":39,"verse":"And no one who has been drinking old wine will wish for new wine, for he says, ‘The old is better.’ ”"}]}
