Send only two or three thousand men to go up and attack Ai.

Why are you lying there on your face?"},{"number":11,"verse":"Israel has sinned. They have broken my covenant which I commanded them. They have stolen some of the things that were set apart. They have stolen and then also hidden their sin by putting what they have taken among their own belongings."},{"number":12,"verse":"As a result, the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies.

Consecrate the people to me and say to them, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow. For Yahweh, the God of Israel says, \"There are things set apart to be destroyed that are still among you, Israel.
