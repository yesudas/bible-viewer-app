Just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me."},{"number":5,"verse":"I am the vine, you are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for without me you can do nothing."},{"number":6,"verse":"If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown away like a branch and dries up, and they gather the branches and throw them into the fire, and they are burned up."},{"number":7,"verse":"If you remain in me, and if my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."},{"number":8,"verse":"My Father is glorified in this, that you bear much fruit and you will be my disciples."},{"number":9,"verse":"As the Father has loved me, I have also loved you.

But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you."},{"number":16,"verse":"You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain. This is so that whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you."},{"number":17,"verse":"These things I command you, so that you love one another."},{"number":18,"verse":"If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you."},{"number":19,"verse":"If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own.
