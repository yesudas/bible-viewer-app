We do not want to be unclothed. Instead, we want to be clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life."},{"number":5,"verse":"The one who prepared us for this very thing is God, who gave us the Spirit as a guarantee of what is to come."},{"number":6,"verse":"Therefore always be confident. Be aware that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord."},{"number":7,"verse":"For we walk by faith, not by sight."},{"number":8,"verse":"So we have confidence.

What we are is clearly seen by God. I expect that it is also clear to your conscience."},{"number":12,"verse":"We are not trying to persuade you again to view us as sincere.

He is entrusting to us the message of reconciliation."},{"number":20,"verse":"So we are appointed as representatives of Christ, as though God were making his appeal through us. We plead with you, for the sake of Christ:\" Be reconciled to God!\""},{"number":21,"verse":"He made Christ become the sacrifice for our sin. He is the one who never sinned. He did this so that we might become the righteousness of God in him."}]}
