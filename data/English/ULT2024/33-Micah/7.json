I have become like the gathering of summer fruit, and like the grapes that have been gleaned; there is no grape cluster to eat, no ripe early fig that my soul desires."},{"number":2,"verse":"The faithful ones have disappeared from the land; there is no upright person in all mankind. They all lie in wait to shed blood; each one hunts his own brother with a net."},{"number":3,"verse":"Their hands are very good at doing harm: the ruler asks for money, the judge is ready for bribes, and the powerful man is saying to others what he wants to obtain. Thus they plot together."},{"number":4,"verse":"The best of them is like a brier, the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge. It is the day foretold by your watchmen, the day of your punishment. Now is the time of their confusion."},{"number":5,"verse":"Do not trust any neighbor; put no confidence in any friend. Be careful about what you say even to the woman who lies in your arms."},{"number":6,"verse":"For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me."},{"number":8,"verse":"Do not rejoice over me, my enemy. After I fall, I will rise.

They will put their hands on their mouths; their ears will be deaf."},{"number":17,"verse":"They will lick the dust like a snake, like creatures that crawl on the earth. They will come out of their dens with fear; they will come with fear to you, Yahweh our God, and they will be afraid because of you."},{"number":18,"verse":"Who is a God like youâ€” who takes away sin, who passes over the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? He does not keep his anger forever, because he delights in his covenant faithfulness."},{"number":19,"verse":"You will again have compassion on us; you will trample our iniquities under your feet. You will throw all our sins into the depths of the sea."},{"number":20,"verse":"You will give truth to Jacob and covenant faithfulness to Abraham, as you swore to our ancestors in ancient days."}]}
