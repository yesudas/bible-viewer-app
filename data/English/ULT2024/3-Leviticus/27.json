If he does at all change one animal for another, then both it and the one for which it is exchanged become holy."},{"number":11,"verse":"However, if what the person has vowed to give Yahweh is in fact unclean, so that Yahweh will not accept it, then the person must bring the animal to a priest."},{"number":12,"verse":"The priest will value it, by the market value of the animal. Whatever value the priest places on the animal, that will be its value."},{"number":13,"verse":"If the owner wishes to redeem it, then a fifth of its value is to be added to its redemption price."},{"number":14,"verse":"When a man sets apart his house as a holy gift to Yahweh, then the priest will set its value as either good or bad.

It will belong to the priest."},{"number":22,"verse":"If a man sets apart a field that he has bought, but that field is not part of his family's land,"},{"number":23,"verse":"then the priest will figure the valuation of it up to the year of Jubilee, and the man must pay its value on that day as a holy gift to Yahweh."},{"number":24,"verse":"In the year of Jubilee, the field will return to the man from whom it was bought, to the land's owner."},{"number":25,"verse":"All the valuations must be set by the weight of the sanctuary shekel. Twenty gerahs must be the equivalent of one shekel."},{"number":26,"verse":"No one may set apart the firstborn among animals, since the firstborn already belongs to Yahweh; whether ox or sheep, it is Yahweh's."},{"number":27,"verse":"If it is an unclean animal, then the owner may buy it back at the valuation of it, and a fifth must be added to that value. If the animal is not redeemed, then it is to be sold at the set value."},{"number":28,"verse":"But nothing that a man devotes to Yahweh, from all that he has, whether human or animal, or his family land, may be sold or redeemed. Everything that is devoted is very holy to Yahweh."},{"number":29,"verse":"No ransom may be paid for the person who is devoted for destruction. That person must be put to death."},{"number":30,"verse":"All the tithe of the land, whether grain grown on the land or fruit from the trees, is Yahweh's. It is holy to Yahweh."},{"number":31,"verse":"If a man redeems any of his tithe, he must add a fifth to its value."},{"number":32,"verse":"As for every tenth of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the shepherd's rod, one-tenth must be set apart to Yahweh."},{"number":33,"verse":"The shepherd must not search for the better or the worse animals, and he must not substitute one for another. If he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed will be holy. It cannot be redeemed.'\""},{"number":34,"verse":"These are the commandments that Yahweh gave at Mount Sinai to Moses for the people of Israel."}]}
