For you have been unfaithful, forsaking your God. You love to pay the wages a prostitute requires on all the threshing floors."},{"number":2,"verse":"But the threshing floor and the winepress will not feed them; the new wine will fail them."},{"number":3,"verse":"They will not continue to live in Yahweh's land; instead, Ephraim will return to Egypt, and one day they will eat unclean food in Assyria."},{"number":4,"verse":"They will pour out no wine offerings to Yahweh, neither will they be pleasing to him. Their sacrifices will be to them like mourners' food: all who eat it will be defiled. For their food will be for themselves only; it will not come into the house of Yahweh."},{"number":5,"verse":"What will you do on the day of an appointed festival, on the day of a festival for Yahweh?"},{"number":6,"verse":"For, look, if they escape from destruction, Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them. As for their treasures of silver— sharp briers will possess them, and thorns will fill their tents."},{"number":7,"verse":"The days for punishment are coming; the days for retribution are coming. Let all Israel know these things. The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane, because of your great iniquity and great hostility."},{"number":8,"verse":"The prophet is the watchman for my God over Ephraim. But a bird snare is on all of his paths, and hostility toward him is in the house of his God."},{"number":9,"verse":"They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah. God will call to mind their iniquity, and he will punish their sins."},{"number":10,"verse":"Yahweh says, \"When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the wilderness. Like the very first fruit of the season on the fig tree, I found your fathers. But they went to Baal Peor, and they devoted themselves to that shameful idol. They became as detestable as the idol they loved."},{"number":11,"verse":"As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird. There will be no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception."},{"number":12,"verse":"Though they have brought up children, I will take them away so that none of them is left. Woe to them when I turn away from them!"},{"number":13,"verse":"I have seen Ephraim, just like Tyre, planted in a meadow, but Ephraim will bring out his children to someone who will slaughter them.\""},{"number":14,"verse":"Give them, Yahweh—what will you give them? Give them a miscarrying womb and breasts that give no milk."},{"number":15,"verse":"\"Because of all their wickedness in Gilgal, that is where I began to hate them. Because of their sinful deeds, I will drive them out of my house. I will love them no more; all their officials are rebels."},{"number":16,"verse":"Ephraim is diseased, and their root is dried up; they bear no fruit. Even if they have children, I will put their beloved children to death.\""},{"number":17,"verse":"My God will reject them because they have not obeyed him. They will become wanderers among the nations."}]}
