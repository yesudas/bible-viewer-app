For I do not even judge myself."},{"number":4,"verse":"I am not aware of any charge being made against me, but that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me."},{"number":5,"verse":"Therefore do not pronounce judgment about anything before the time, before the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his praise from God."},{"number":6,"verse":"Now, brothers, I applied these principles to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that from us you might learn the meaning of the saying, \" Do not go beyond what is written.\" This is so that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against the other."},{"number":7,"verse":"For who sees any difference between you and others?

We have become, and are still considered to be, the refuse of the world and the filthiest of all things."},{"number":14,"verse":"I do not write these things to shame you, but to correct you as my beloved children."},{"number":15,"verse":"For even if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers.

Shall I come to you with a rod or with love and in a spirit of gentleness?"}]}
