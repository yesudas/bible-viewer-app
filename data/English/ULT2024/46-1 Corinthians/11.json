I praise you because you hold fast to the traditions just as I delivered them to you."},{"number":3,"verse":"Now I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, that a man is the head of a woman, and that God is the head of Christ."},{"number":4,"verse":"Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head."},{"number":5,"verse":"But any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is the same thing as if her head were shaved."},{"number":6,"verse":"For if a woman will not cover her head, she should cut her hair short. If it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or for her to shave her head, let her cover her head."},{"number":7,"verse":"For a man should not have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man."},{"number":8,"verse":"For man was not made from woman. Instead, woman was made from man."},{"number":9,"verse":"For neither was man created for woman. Instead, woman was created for man."},{"number":10,"verse":"This is why the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels."},{"number":11,"verse":"Nevertheless, in the Lord, the woman is not independent from the man, nor is the man independent from the woman."},{"number":12,"verse":"For as the woman comes from the man, so does the man come from the woman.

For when you come together, it is not for the better but for the worse."},{"number":18,"verse":"For in the first place, I hear that when you come together in the church, there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it."},{"number":19,"verse":"For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may be recognized among you."},{"number":20,"verse":"For when you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper that you eat."},{"number":21,"verse":"When you eat, each one eats his own food before the others have their meal. One is hungry, and another becomes drunk."},{"number":22,"verse":"Do you not have houses to eat and to drink in? Do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I will not praise you for this!"},{"number":23,"verse":"For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, took bread."},{"number":24,"verse":"After he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you. Do this to remember me.\""},{"number":25,"verse":"In the same way he took the cup after supper, and he said, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood.

And about the other things you wrote, I will give directions when I come."}]}
