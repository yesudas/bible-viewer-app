This mystery was revealed to me so that you, king, may understand the meaning, and so that you may know the thoughts deep within you."},{"number":31,"verse":"King, you looked up and you saw a large statue. This statue, which was very powerful and bright, stood before you. Its brightness was terrifying."},{"number":32,"verse":"The head of the statue was made of fine gold.

It will shatter all these things and crush them."},{"number":41,"verse":"Just as you saw, the feet and toes were partly made of baked clay and partly made of iron, so it will be a divided kingdom; some of the strength of iron will be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay."},{"number":42,"verse":"As the toes of the feet were partly made of iron and partly made of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle."},{"number":43,"verse":"As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so the people will be a mixture; they will not stay together, just as iron does not mix with clay."},{"number":44,"verse":"In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be conquered by another people.
