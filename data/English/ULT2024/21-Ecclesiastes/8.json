Who can tell him what is coming?"},{"number":8,"verse":"No one is ruler over his breath so as to stop the breath, [ Some versions have No one is ruler over the wind so as to stop the wind. ] and no one has power over the day of his death. No one is discharged from the army during a battle, and wickedness will not rescue those who are its slaves."},{"number":9,"verse":"I have realized all this; I have applied my heart to every kind of work that is done under the sun.

Things happen to righteous people as they happen to wicked people, and things happen to wicked people as they happen to righteous people. I say that this also is useless vapor."},{"number":15,"verse":"So I recommend happiness, because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat and drink and to be happy. It is happiness that will accompany him in his labor for all the days of his life that God has given him under the sun."},{"number":16,"verse":"When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to understand the work that is done on the earth, work often done without sleep for the eyes at night or in the day,"},{"number":17,"verse":"then I considered all of God's deeds, and that man cannot understand the work that is done under the sun.
