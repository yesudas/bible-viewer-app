And behold, the tears of oppressed people, and they had no one to comfort them! Power was in the hand of their oppressors, and there was no one to comfort them!"},{"number":2,"verse":"So I considered those who are already dead more fortunate than the living, who are still alive."},{"number":3,"verse":"However, more fortunate than both of them is the one who has not yet lived, the one who has not seen any of the evil acts that are done under the sun."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then I saw that every act of labor and every skillful work became the envy of one's neighbor. This also is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind."},{"number":5,"verse":"The fool folds his hands and does not work, so his food is his own flesh."},{"number":6,"verse":"But better is a handful of profit with quiet work than two handfuls with the work that tries to shepherd the wind."},{"number":7,"verse":"Then I thought again about more futility, more vanishing vapor under the sun."},{"number":8,"verse":"There is the kind of man who is alone. He does not have anyone, no son or brother. There is no end to all his work, and his eyes are not satisfied with gaining wealth.
