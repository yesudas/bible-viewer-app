So my mouth was open; I was no longer mute!"},{"number":23,"verse":"Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,"},{"number":24,"verse":"\"Son of man, the ones inhabiting those ruins in the land of Israel are talking and say, 'Abraham was only one person, and he inherited the land, but we are many! The land has been given to us as a possession.'"},{"number":25,"verse":"Therefore say to them, 'The Lord Yahweh says this: You eat blood, and you lift up your eyes towards your idols, then you pour out people's blood.
