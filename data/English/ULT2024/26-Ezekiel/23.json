They acted as prostitutes there. Their breasts were squeezed and their virgin nipples were fondled there."},{"number":4,"verse":"Their names were Oholah—the older sister—and Oholibah—her younger sister. Then they became mine and bore sons and daughters. Their names mean this: Oholah means Samaria, and Oholibah means Jerusalem."},{"number":5,"verse":"But Oholah acted as a prostitute even when she was mine; she lusted for her lovers, for the Assyrians who were dominant,"},{"number":6,"verse":"the governor who wore blue, and for his officials, who were strong and handsome, all of them men riding on horses."},{"number":7,"verse":"So she gave herself as a prostitute to them, to all the best of Assyria's men, and she made herself unclean with everyone she lusted for—and with all their idols."},{"number":8,"verse":"For she had not left her prostitute behavior behind in Egypt, when they had lain with her when she had been a young girl, when they caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her."},{"number":9,"verse":"Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians for whom she lusted."},{"number":10,"verse":"They uncovered her nakedness, took her sons and daughters, killed her with the sword, and she became notorious among other women, so they executed judgment on her."},{"number":11,"verse":"Her sister Oholibah saw this, but she lusted even more passionately and acted like a prostitute even more than her sister."},{"number":12,"verse":"She lusted for the Assyrians, the governors and the dominating officials who dressed impressively, who were men riding horses.

I will give you into the hand of the ones you hate, back into the hand of the ones from whom you had turned away."},{"number":29,"verse":"They will deal with you hatefully; they will take all your possessions and abandon you naked and bare, and your nakedness will be uncovered just as when you engaged in promiscuity and prostitutions."},{"number":30,"verse":"These things will be done to you in your acting like a prostitute, lusting after nations by which you became unclean with their idols."},{"number":31,"verse":"You have walked in the way of your sister, so I will put her cup of punishment into your hand.'"},{"number":32,"verse":"The Lord Yahweh says this, 'You will drink your sister's cup that is deep and large.

So present to them their disgusting actions,"},{"number":37,"verse":"since they have committed adultery, and since there is blood on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols, and they have even caused their sons to pass through the fire, as food for their idols."},{"number":38,"verse":"Then they continue to do this to me: They make my sanctuary unclean, and on the same day they defile my Sabbaths."},{"number":39,"verse":"For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, then they came to my sanctuary on the same day to defile it! So behold! This is what they have done in the middle of my house."},{"number":40,"verse":"You sent out for men who came from far away, to whom messengers had been sent—now behold. They indeed came, those for whom you bathed, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry."},{"number":41,"verse":"There you sat on a beautiful bed and at a table arranged before it where you placed my incense and my oil."},{"number":42,"verse":"So the sound of a noisy crowd was around her; including all kinds of men, even Sabeans were brought in from the wilderness, and they put bracelets on their hands and beautiful crowns on their heads."},{"number":43,"verse":"Then I said of her who was worn out by adultery, 'Now they will be sexually immoral with her, and she with them.'"},{"number":44,"verse":"They went in to her, as men go in to a prostitute.
