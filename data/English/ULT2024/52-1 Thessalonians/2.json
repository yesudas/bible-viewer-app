We were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much struggling."},{"number":3,"verse":"For our exhortation was not from error, nor from impurity, nor from deceit."},{"number":4,"verse":"Instead, just as we have been approved by God to be trusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but God. He is the one who examines our hearts."},{"number":5,"verse":"For we did not come at that time with words of flattery, as you know, nor with a pretext to cover up greed— God is our witness."},{"number":6,"verse":"Nor did we seek glory from people, either from you or from others."},{"number":7,"verse":"We could have been a burden as apostles of Christ. Instead, we became like little children among you. As when a mother comforts her own children, [ Some ancient copies read, Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children. ]"},{"number":8,"verse":"thus we had affection for you. We were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives. For you had become very dear to us."},{"number":9,"verse":"For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil.
