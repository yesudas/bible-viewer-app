I spoke privately to those who seemed to be important, in order to make sure that I was not running— or had not run— in vain."},{"number":3,"verse":"But not even Titus, who was with me and who was a Greek, was forced to be circumcised."},{"number":4,"verse":"But this happened because of the false brothers who came in secretly. They came in secretly to spy on our liberty that we have in Christ Jesus so they could make us slaves,"},{"number":5,"verse":"but we did not yield in submission to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you."},{"number":6,"verse":"But those who seemed to be important (whatever they were does not matter to me, God does not accept people based on their appearance)— indeed, those who seemed important added nothing to me."},{"number":7,"verse":"On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to those who are uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to those who are circumcised."},{"number":8,"verse":"For God, who worked in Peter for the apostleship to those who are circumcised, also worked in me to the Gentiles."},{"number":9,"verse":"When James and Cephas and John, who were recognized as pillars, understood the grace that had been given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me.

But when these men came, he withdrew and kept himself away from the Gentiles. He was afraid of those who were demanding circumcision."},{"number":13,"verse":"The rest of the Jews also joined with him in this hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy."},{"number":14,"verse":"But when I saw that they were not behaving correctly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of all of them, \"If you are a Jew but are living like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?\""},{"number":15,"verse":"We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners;"},{"number":16,"verse":"yet we know that no person is justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ.
