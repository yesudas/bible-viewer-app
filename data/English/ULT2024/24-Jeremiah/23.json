You have not cared for them. So I am about to punish you for the evil you have done—this is Yahweh's declaration."},{"number":3,"verse":"I myself will gather the remnant of my flock from all of the lands where I have driven them, and I will return them to a grazing place, where they will be fruitful and increase."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them so they will no longer fear or be shattered. None of them will go missing—this is Yahweh's declaration."},{"number":5,"verse":"See, the days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when I will raise up for David a righteous branch. He will reign as king; he will act wisely and cause justice and righteousness in the land."},{"number":6,"verse":"In his days Judah will be rescued, and Israel will live in security.

I even found their wickedness in my house!—this is Yahweh's declaration—"},{"number":12,"verse":"therefore their way will be like a slippery place in the darkness. They will be pushed down.

All of them have become like Sodom to me and its inhabitants like Gomorrah!\""},{"number":15,"verse":"Therefore Yahweh of hosts says this concerning the prophets, \"Look, I am about to make them eat wormwood and drink poisonous water, for pollution has gone out from the prophets of Jerusalem to all the land.\""},{"number":16,"verse":"Yahweh of hosts says this, \"Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They have deluded you! They are announcing visions from their own minds, not from Yahweh's mouth."},{"number":17,"verse":"They are constantly saying to those who dishonor me, 'Yahweh declares there will be peace for you.'

They said, 'I had a dream! I had a dream!'"},{"number":26,"verse":"How long will this go on, prophets who prophesy lies from their minds, and who prophesy from the deceit in their hearts?"},{"number":27,"verse":"They are planning on making my people forget my name with the dreams that they report, each one to his neighbor, just as their ancestors forgot my name in favor of Baal's name."},{"number":28,"verse":"The prophet who has a dream, let him report the dream. But the one to whom I have declared something, let him declare my word truthfully. What does straw have to do with grain?—this is Yahweh's declaration—"},{"number":29,"verse":"Is not my word like fire?—this is Yahweh's declaration—and like a hammer that shatters a rock into pieces?"},{"number":30,"verse":"So see, I am against the prophets—this is Yahweh's declaration—anyone who steals words from another person and says they come from me."},{"number":31,"verse":"See, I am against the prophets—this is Yahweh's declaration—who use their tongues to prophesy proclamations."},{"number":32,"verse":"See, I am against the prophets who dream deceitfully—this is Yahweh's declaration—and then proclaim them and in this way mislead my people with their deceit and boasting.
