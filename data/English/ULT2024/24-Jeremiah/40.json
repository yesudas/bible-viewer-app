He did just as he had decreed, since you people sinned against him and did not obey his voice. That is why this thing has happened to you people."},{"number":4,"verse":"But now look! I have released you today from the chains that were on your hands. If it is good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take care of you. But if it is not good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, then do not do so. Look at all the land before you. Go where it is good and right in your eyes to go.\""},{"number":5,"verse":"When Jeremiah did not reply, Nebuzaradan said, \"Go to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has put in charge of the cities of Judah. Stay with him among the people or go wherever it is good in your eyes to go.\" The commander of the king's bodyguards gave him food and a gift, and then sent him away."},{"number":6,"verse":"So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. He stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land."},{"number":7,"verse":"Now some commanders of Judean soldiers who were still in the countryside—they and their men—heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah son of Ahikam governor over the land.
