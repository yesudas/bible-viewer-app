And my brother commanded me [to be] there. And now, if I have found favor in your eyes, I pray you let me get away and see my brothers. And he does not come to the king's table."},{"number":30,"verse":"And Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse, rebellious [woman], do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own confusion, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?"},{"number":31,"verse":"For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom.
