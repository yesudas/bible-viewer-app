I have been filled with comfort, I am overflowing with joy on all our trouble."},{"number":5,"verse":"For, indeed, coming into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but being troubled in every way, [with] fightings [on the] outside, and fears [on the] inside."},{"number":6,"verse":"But He who comforts the lowly comforted us by the coming of Titus."},{"number":7,"verse":"And not only by his coming, but by the comfort with which he was comforted over you, telling us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more."},{"number":8,"verse":"For even if I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret; if indeed I did regret; for I see that that letter grieved you for an hour."},{"number":9,"verse":"Now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you grieved to repentance.
