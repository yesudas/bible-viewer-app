And likewise also the husband does not have authority [over his] own body, but the wife."},{"number":5,"verse":"Do not deprive one another, unless [it is] with consent for a time, so that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. And come together again so that Satan does not tempt you for your incontinence."},{"number":6,"verse":"But I speak this according to permission, not according to commandment."},{"number":7,"verse":"For I would that all men were even as I myself am.

It remains that both those who have wives should be as not having one."},{"number":30,"verse":"And they who weep are as [though they did] not weep.

The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please [her husband."},{"number":35,"verse":"And this I speak for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare on you, but for that which is right, and that you may attend on the Lord without distraction."},{"number":36,"verse":"But if anyone thinks [it] behaving himself indecently toward his virgin (if she is past [her] prime, and so it ought to be) let him do what he will; he does not sin; let them marry."},{"number":37,"verse":"But [he] who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but who has authority over [his] own will (and has so judged in his heart that he will keep his virginity) he does well."},{"number":38,"verse":"So then he who gives in marriage does well.
