All her friends have dealt deceitfully with her; they became her enemies."},{"number":3,"verse":"Judah went into captivity because of affliction, and from great slavery. She dwells among the nations; she finds no rest; all her pursuers have overtaken her between the narrows."},{"number":4,"verse":"The roads of Zion mourn without [any] going to the appointed feasts. All her gates are deserted; her priests sigh; her virgins are afflicted, and she [is] in bitterness."},{"number":5,"verse":"Her enemies have become as chief; her haters are at ease; for the LORD has afflicted her for the multitude of her sins.

He has spread a net for my feet; He has turned me back; He has made me amazed [and] faint all the day."},{"number":14,"verse":"The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand; they intertwine; they rise on my neck. He has made my strength to falter; the LORD has delivered me into [their] hands.

The LORD has trod the virgin daughter of Judah, [as] in a winepress."},{"number":16,"verse":"For these I weep; my eye, my eye runs down [with] water, because the comforter who could refresh my soul is far from me. My sons are desolated because the enemy prevails."},{"number":17,"verse":"Zion spreads forth her hands; none [is] comforting to me; the LORD has commanded concerning Jacob that his enemies [should be] all around him; Jerusalem has become as an impure thing among them."},{"number":18,"verse":"The LORD [is] righteous, for I have rebelled against His command. I beseech you, all peoples, hear and behold my sorrow.

On the outside the sword bereaves; in the house [it is] as death."},{"number":21,"verse":"They hear that I sigh; [there is] none to comfort me. All my enemies have heard my evil; they are glad that You have done [it]. You will bring the day [that] You have called, and they shall be like me."},{"number":22,"verse":"Let all their wickedness come before You; and do to them as You have done to me for all my transgressions. For my sighs [are] many, and my heart [is] faint."}]}
