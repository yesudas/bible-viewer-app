Then whoever first stepped in after the troubling of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had."},{"number":5,"verse":"And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty-eight years."},{"number":6,"verse":"When Jesus saw him lying, and knowing that he had spent much time, He said to him, Do you desire to be made whole?"},{"number":7,"verse":"The infirm man answered Him, Sir, when the water is troubled, I have no one to put me into the pool. But while I am coming, another steps down before me."},{"number":8,"verse":"Jesus says to him, Rise, take up your bed and walk."},{"number":9,"verse":"And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked. And it was a sabbath on that day."},{"number":10,"verse":"Therefore the Jews said to him who had been healed, It is the sabbath. It is not lawful for you to take up the bed."},{"number":11,"verse":"He answered them, He who made me whole said to me, Take up your bed and walk."},{"number":12,"verse":"Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed and walk?"},{"number":13,"verse":"And he did not know Him who had cured him, for Jesus had moved away, a crowd being in the place."},{"number":14,"verse":"Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you are made whole.

For whatever things He does, these also the Son does likewise."},{"number":20,"verse":"For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all the things that He Himself does. And He will show Him greater works than these, so that you may marvel."},{"number":21,"verse":"For as the Father raises the dead and makes alive, even so the Son of man makes alive whomever He wills."},{"number":22,"verse":"For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son,"},{"number":23,"verse":"so that all should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.

As I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of [the] Father who has sent Me."},{"number":31,"verse":"If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true."},{"number":32,"verse":"There is another who bears witness of Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true."},{"number":33,"verse":"You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth."},{"number":34,"verse":"But I do not receive testimony from man, but these things I say so that you might be saved."},{"number":35,"verse":"He was a burning and shining light, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light."},{"number":36,"verse":"But I have greater witness than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me that I should finish them, the works which I do themselves witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me."},{"number":37,"verse":"And He sending Me, the Father Himself, has borne witness of Me. Neither have you heard His voice at any time nor seen His shape."},{"number":38,"verse":"And you do not have His Word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He has sent."},{"number":39,"verse":"You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life.
