I got men singers and women singers for myself, and the delights of the sons of men, a wife and very many wives."},{"number":9,"verse":"I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me."},{"number":10,"verse":"And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not withhold my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my part of all my labor."},{"number":11,"verse":"Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit; and [there is] no profit under the sun."},{"number":12,"verse":"And I turned to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what [can] the man [do] who comes after the king, when they have already done it?"},{"number":13,"verse":"Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness."},{"number":14,"verse":"The wise man's eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walks in darkness; and I also knew that one event happens to all of them."},{"number":15,"verse":"Then I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, [so] it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? And I said in my heart that this also [is] vanity."},{"number":16,"verse":"For [there is] no memory of the wise [more than] of the fool forever, since that which is now shall all be forgotten in the days to come. And how does the wise die above the fool!"},{"number":17,"verse":"Therefore I hated life; because the work that is done under the sun [is] sad to me; for all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit."},{"number":18,"verse":"Yes, I hated all my labor which I had done under the sun; that I must leave it to the man who shall be after me."},{"number":19,"verse":"And who knows [whether] he shall be wise or a fool? Yet he shall have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and acted wisely under the sun. This [is] also vanity."},{"number":20,"verse":"And I turned to cause my heart to despair over all the labor which I did under the sun."},{"number":21,"verse":"When there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and with success; yet to a man who has not labored in it, he shall leave it [for] his share.

This [is] also vanity."},{"number":24,"verse":"Is it not good that he should eat and drink and make his soul see good in his labor? This I also saw, that it [was] from the hand of God."},{"number":25,"verse":"For who can eat, or who can enjoy, apart from me?"},{"number":26,"verse":"For [God] gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy to a man who [is] good in His sight. But to the sinner He gives labor, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to [him who is] good before God. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit."}]}
