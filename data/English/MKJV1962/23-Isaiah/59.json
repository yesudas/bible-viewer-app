They conceive mischief and bring out iniquity."},{"number":5,"verse":"They hatch adders' eggs and weave the spider's web; he who eats their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper."},{"number":6,"verse":"Their webs shall not become clothing, nor shall they cover themselves with their works; their works [are] works of iniquity, and the act of violence [is] in their hands."},{"number":7,"verse":"Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts [are] thoughts of iniquity; wasting and ruin [are] in their paths."},{"number":8,"verse":"They did not know the way of peace, and [there is] no judgment in their paths. They have made crooked paths for themselves; whoever goes in them shall not know peace."},{"number":9,"verse":"Therefore judgment is far from us; nor does justice overtake us.

Therefore His own arm brought salvation to Him; and His righteousness sustained Him."},{"number":17,"verse":"For He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on His head. And He put on the garments of vengeance [for] clothing, and was covered with zeal like a cloak."},{"number":18,"verse":"According to [their] deeds, accordingly He will repay; fury to His foes, deed for deed to His enemies. He will repay their deeds to the coastlands."},{"number":19,"verse":"So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun.
