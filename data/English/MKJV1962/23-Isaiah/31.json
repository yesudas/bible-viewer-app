When the LORD shall stretch out His hand, both he who helps shall fall, and he who is helped shall fall down, and they shall all cease together."},{"number":4,"verse":"For so has the LORD spoken to me: As the lion roars, even the young lion on his prey when a multitude of shepherds are gathered against him, [he] will not be afraid of their voice, nor fret himself because of their noise. So Jehovah of hosts shall come down to fight for Mount Zion, and on its hill."},{"number":5,"verse":"As birds flying, so the LORD of hosts will defend Jerusalem; also defending, He will deliver [it]; and passing over He will preserve [it]."},{"number":6,"verse":"Turn to [Him from] whom the sons of Israel have deeply revolted."},{"number":7,"verse":"For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made [for] you, a sin."},{"number":8,"verse":"Then Assyria shall fall with the sword, not of [great] man; and the sword, not of [lowly] man, shall devour him.
