{"bibles":[{"id":1,"isDefault":false,"info":{"abbr":"TRC1535","commonName":"Tyndale Bible 1535","shortName":"TRC 1535","longName":"Tyndale Bible 1535","longEnglishName":"Tyndale Bible 1535","languageCode":"en","publishedYear":"1535","publishedBy":"William Tyndale","translatedBy":"The Tyndale Bible (TYN) generally refers to the body of biblical translations by William Tyndale into Early Modern English, made c. 1522 - 1535. Tyndale's biblical text is credited with being the first Anglophone Biblical translation to work directly from Hebrew and Greek texts, although it relied heavily upon the Latin Vulgate and Luther's German New Testament. Furthermore, it was the first English biblical translation that was mass-produced as a result of new advances in the art of printing. The term \"Tyndale's Bible\" is not strictly correct, because Tyndale never published a complete English language Bible; instead, a completely translated Bible was completed by Myles Coverdale, who supplemented Tyndale's translations with his own to produce the first complete printed Bible in English in 1535. Before his execution, Tyndale had translated the New Testament, the Pentateuch, and the historical books of the Old Testament. Of the Old Testament books, the Pentateuch, Book of Jonah, and a revised version of the Book of Genesis were published during Tyndale's lifetime. His other Old Testament works were first used in the creation of the Matthew Bible and also greatly influenced subsequent English translations of the Bible.","copyRight":"Public Domain","additionalInformation":null},"books":[{"bookNo":1,"shortName":"Gen","longName":"Genesis","englishName":"Genesis","chapterCount":50},{"bookNo":2,"shortName":"Exo","longName":"Exodus","englishName":"Exodus","chapterCount":40},{"bookNo":3,"shortName":"Lev","longName":"Leviticus","englishName":"Leviticus","chapterCount":27},{"bookNo":4,"shortName":"Num","longName":"Numbers","englishName":"Numbers","chapterCount":36},{"bookNo":5,"shortName":"Deu","longName":"Deuteronomy","englishName":"Deuteronomy","chapterCount":34},{"bookNo":32,"shortName":"Jon","longName":"Jonah","englishName":"Jonah","chapterCount":4},{"bookNo":40,"shortName":"Mat","longName":"Matthew","englishName":"Matthew","chapterCount":28},{"bookNo":41,"shortName":"Mar","longName":"Mark","englishName":"Mark","chapterCount":16},{"bookNo":42,"shortName":"Luk","longName":"Luke","englishName":"Luke","chapterCount":24},{"bookNo":43,"shortName":"Joh","longName":"John","englishName":"John","chapterCount":21},{"bookNo":44,"shortName":"Act","longName":"Acts of the Apostles","englishName":"Acts of the Apostles","chapterCount":28},{"bookNo":45,"shortName":"Rom","longName":"Romans","englishName":"Romans","chapterCount":16},{"bookNo":46,"shortName":"1Co","longName":"1 Corinthians","englishName":"1 Corinthians","chapterCount":16},{"bookNo":47,"shortName":"2Co","longName":"2 Corinthians","englishName":"2 Corinthians","chapterCount":13},{"bookNo":48,"shortName":"Gal","longName":"Galatians","englishName":"Galatians","chapterCount":6},{"bookNo":49,"shortName":"Eph","longName":"Ephesians","englishName":"Ephesians","chapterCount":6},{"bookNo":50,"shortName":"Php","longName":"Philippians","englishName":"Philippians","chapterCount":4},{"bookNo":51,"shortName":"Col","longName":"Colossians","englishName":"Colossians","chapterCount":4},{"bookNo":52,"shortName":"1Th","longName":"1 Thessalonians","englishName":"1 Thessalonians","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":53,"shortName":"2Th","longName":"2 Thessalonians","englishName":"2 Thessalonians","chapterCount":3},{"bookNo":54,"shortName":"1Ti","longName":"1 Timothy","englishName":"1 Timothy","chapterCount":6},{"bookNo":55,"shortName":"2Ti","longName":"2 Timothy","englishName":"2 Timothy","chapterCount":4},{"bookNo":56,"shortName":"Tit","longName":"Titus","englishName":"Titus","chapterCount":3},{"bookNo":57,"shortName":"Phm","longName":"Philemon","englishName":"Philemon","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":58,"shortName":"Heb","longName":"Hebrews","englishName":"Hebrews","chapterCount":13},{"bookNo":59,"shortName":"Jas","longName":"James","englishName":"James","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":60,"shortName":"1Pe","longName":"1 Peter","englishName":"1 Peter","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":61,"shortName":"2Pe","longName":"2 Peter","englishName":"2 Peter","chapterCount":3},{"bookNo":62,"shortName":"1Jn","longName":"1 John","englishName":"1 John","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":63,"shortName":"2Jn","longName":"2 John","englishName":"2 John","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":64,"shortName":"3Jn","longName":"3 John","englishName":"3 John","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":65,"shortName":"Jud","longName":"Jude","englishName":"Jude","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":66,"shortName":"Rev","longName":"Revelation","englishName":"Revelation","chapterCount":22}]}]}
