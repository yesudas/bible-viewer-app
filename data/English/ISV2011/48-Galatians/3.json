{"bibleAbbr":"ISV2011","bookName":"Galatians","bookEnglishName":"Galatians","chapterNumber":3,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"{Believers are Approved by God} d You foolish Galatians! Who put you under a spell? Was not Jesus the Messiah {Or Christ} clearly portrayed before your very eyes as having been crucified?"},{"number":2,"verse":"I want to learn only one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by doing {Lit. Spirit through} the actions of the Law or by believing what you heard? {Lit. or through the hearing of faith}"},{"number":3,"verse":"Are you so foolish? Having started out with the Spirit, are you now ending up with the flesh?"},{"number":4,"verse":"Did you suffer so much for nothing? (If it really was for nothing!)"},{"number":5,"verse":"Does God {Lit. he} supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you because you do the actions {Lit. you through the works} of the Law or because you believe what you heard? {Lit. you through the hearing of faith}"},{"number":6,"verse":"In the same way, Abraham \"believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\" {Gen 15:6}"},{"number":7,"verse":"You see, then, that those who have faith are Abraham's real descendants."},{"number":8,"verse":"Because the Scripture saw ahead of time that God would justify the gentiles {Or nations} by faith, it announced the gospel to Abraham beforehand when it said, \"Through you all nations {Or all the gentiles} will be blessed.\" {Gen 12:3}"},{"number":9,"verse":"Therefore, those who believe are blessed together with Abraham, the one who believed."},{"number":10,"verse":"{No One is Justified by the Law} d Certainly all who depend on the actions of the Law are under a curse. For it is written, \"A curse on everyone who does not obey everything that is written in the Book of the Law!\" {Deut 27:26}"},{"number":11,"verse":"Now it is obvious that no one is justified in the sight of God by the Law, because \"The righteous will live by faith.\" {Hab 2:4}"},{"number":12,"verse":"But the Law has nothing to do with faith. Instead, \"The person who keeps the commandments {Lit. who does them} will have life in them.\" {Lev 18:5}"},{"number":13,"verse":"The Messiah {Or Christ} redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written, \"A curse on everyone who is hung on a tree!\" {Deut 21:23}"},{"number":14,"verse":"This happened {The Gk. lacks This happened} in order that the blessing promised to {Lit. the blessing of} Abraham would come to the gentiles through the Messiah {Or Christ} Jesus, so that we might receive the promised Spirit {Or the promise of the Spirit} through faith."},{"number":15,"verse":"Brothers, let me use an example from everyday life. {Lit. I am speaking according to man} Once a person's will has been ratified, no one can cancel it or add conditions to it."},{"number":16,"verse":"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. It doesn't say \"descendants,\"referring to many, but \"your descendant,\"{Gen 12:7} referring to one person, who is the Messiah. {Or Christ}"},{"number":17,"verse":"This is what I mean: The Law that came 430 years later did not cancel the covenant that God ratified previously. The promise was never nullified."},{"number":18,"verse":"For if the inheritance comes about through the Law, it no longer comes about through the promise. But it was through a promise that God so graciously gave it to Abraham."},{"number":19,"verse":"{The Purpose of the Law} d Why, then, was the Law added? {The Gk. lacks added} Because of transgressions, until the descendant {Lit. seed} came about whom the promise pertained. It was put into effect through angels by means of a mediator."},{"number":20,"verse":"Now a mediator involves more than one party, but God is one."},{"number":21,"verse":"So is the Law in conflict with the promises of God? Of course not! For if a law had been given that could give us life, then certainly righteousness would come through the Law."},{"number":22,"verse":"But the Scripture has captured everything by means of sin's net, so that what was promised by the faithfulness of {Or by faith in} the Messiah {Or Christ} might be granted to those who believe."},{"number":23,"verse":"Now before faith came about, we were held in custody and confined under the Law in preparation for the faith that was to be revealed."},{"number":24,"verse":"And so the Law was our guardian until the Messiah {Or Christ} came, so that we might be justified by faith."},{"number":25,"verse":"But now that faith has come about, we are no longer under a guardian."},{"number":26,"verse":"{You are God's Children} d For all of you are God's children through faith in the Messiah {Or Christ} Jesus."},{"number":27,"verse":"Indeed, all of you who were baptized into the Messiah {Or Christ} have clothed yourselves with the Messiah. {Or Christ}"},{"number":28,"verse":"Because all of you are one in the Messiah {Or Christ} Jesus, a person is no longer a Jew or a Greek, a slave or a free person, a male or a female."},{"number":29,"verse":"And if you belong to the Messiah, {Or Christ} then you are Abraham's descendants indeed, and heirs according to the promise."}]}
