Nevertheless, we're about to force our sons and daughters into slavery, and some of our daughters are already in bondage. It's beyond our power to do anything about it, because our fields and vineyards belong to others.\""},{"number":6,"verse":"I became very livid when I heard their complaining and these charges."},{"number":7,"verse":"So after thinking it over carefully, I accused the officials and nobles openly, \"Every one of you is charging your fellow countrymen interest!\" So I opened a public investigation against them."},{"number":8,"verse":"I accused them, \"To the best of our ability, we've been buying back our fellow Jews who had been sold to foreigners. Even now you're selling your fellow countrymen, only for them to be sold back to us!\" They kept quiet and never spoke a word."},{"number":9,"verse":"So I said, \"What you're doing isn't right!

And the people kept their promise."},{"number":14,"verse":"{Nehemiah Refuses the Governor's Allotment} d In addition, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah (that is, during the twelve years from the twentieth to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes), neither I nor my relatives relied on the provisions {Lit. have eaten the bread} allotted to the governor."},{"number":15,"verse":"Nevertheless, the former governors before me placed a heavy burden on the people. They received food and wine, plus a tax of {The Heb. lacks a tax of} 40 shekels of silver.
