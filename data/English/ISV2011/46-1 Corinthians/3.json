And you're still not ready!"},{"number":3,"verse":"That's because you are still worldly. As long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you, you are worldly and living by human standards, aren't you?"},{"number":4,"verse":"For when one person says, \"I follow Paul,\"and another person says, \"I follow to Apollos,\"you're following {The Gk. lacks following} your own human nature, aren't you?"},{"number":5,"verse":"Who is Apollos, anyhow? Or who is Paul? They're merely servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord gave to each of us his task."},{"number":6,"verse":"I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept everything growing."},{"number":7,"verse":"So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is significant, but God, who keeps everything growing, is the one who matters."},{"number":8,"verse":"The one who plants and the one who waters have the same goal, and each will receive a reward for his own action."},{"number":9,"verse":"For we are God's co-workers. You are God's farmland and God's building."},{"number":10,"verse":"{The Messiah is Our Foundation} d As an expert builder using the grace that God gave me, I laid the foundation, and someone else is building on it.
