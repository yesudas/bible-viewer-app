And if the world is going to be ruled by you, can't you handle insignificant cases?"},{"number":3,"verse":"You know that we will rule angels, not to mention things in this life, don't you?"},{"number":4,"verse":"So if you have cases dealing with this life, why do you appoint as judges people who have no standing in the church?"},{"number":5,"verse":"I say this to make you feel ashamed. Has it come to this, that there is not one person among you who is wise enough to settle disagreements between brothers? {Lit. between his brother}"},{"number":6,"verse":"Instead, one brother goes to court against another brother, and before unbelieving judges, {The Gk. lacks judges} at that!"},{"number":7,"verse":"The very fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves is already a defeat for you. Why not rather just accept the wrong? Why not rather be cheated?"},{"number":8,"verse":"Instead, you yourselves practice doing wrong and cheating others, and brothers at that!"},{"number":9,"verse":"You know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God, don't you?

For it is said, \"The two will become one flesh.\" {Gen 2:24}"},{"number":17,"verse":"But the person who unites himself with the Lord becomes one spirit with him."},{"number":18,"verse":"Keep on running away from sexual immorality.
