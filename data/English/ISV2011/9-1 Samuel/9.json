A prominent man {I. e. a man of wealth, military skill, or high reputation} from Benjamin,"},{"number":2,"verse":"he had a son named Saul, who was a choice and handsome {Or good} young man.

Then they went through the region of Shaalim, but they were not there. They also went through the territory of the descendants of Benjamin, but they did not find them."},{"number":5,"verse":"When they entered the region of Zuph, Saul told the {Lit. his} young man with him, \"Come on, let's go back so my father does not stop worrying {The Heb. lacks worrying} about the donkeys and become anxious about us.\""},{"number":6,"verse":"The young man {Lit.

Come on, let's go!\" Then they entered the town where the man of God was."},{"number":11,"verse":"As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women going out to draw water, and they told them, \"Is the seer here?\""},{"number":12,"verse":"They answered them: \"Yes, he's right there ahead of you. Hurry, for he came to town just today because there is a sacrifice for the people on the high place today."},{"number":13,"verse":"When you come into town you can find him before he goes up to the high place to eat.

In the morning I'll send you away and tell you everything that is on your mind."},{"number":20,"verse":"Now as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, don't give any thought to them, because they've been found. Meanwhile, to whom is all Israel looking, if not to you and all of your father's household?\""},{"number":21,"verse":"Saul answered: \"Am I not a descendant of Benjamin from the least of the tribes of Israel? Isn't my family the least important of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why have you spoken to me like this?\""},{"number":22,"verse":"Then Samuel took Saul and his young man and brought them to a room where he gave them a place at the head of those who were invited, of whom there were about 30 men."},{"number":23,"verse":"Then Samuel told the cook, \"Bring the portion that I gave you, the one I told you to set aside.\""},{"number":24,"verse":"The cook picked up the thigh and what was on it and set it in front of Saul.
