But the free gift} is not like Adam's offense. {Lit. like the offense} For if many people died as the result of one man's offense, how much more have God's grace and the free gift given through the kindness of one man, Jesus the Messiah, {Or Christ} been showered on many people!"},{"number":16,"verse":"Nor can the free gift be compared to what came through the man who sinned. {Lit. nor is the gift like the man who sinned} For the sentence that followed one man's offense resulted in condemnation, but the free gift brought justification, even after many offenses."},{"number":17,"verse":"For if, through one man, death ruled because of that man's offense, how much more will those who receive such overflowing grace and the gift of righteousness rule in life because of one man, Jesus the Messiah! {Or Christ}"},{"number":18,"verse":"Consequently, just as one offense resulted in condemnation for everyone, so one act of righteousness results in justification and life for everyone."},{"number":19,"verse":"For just as through one man's disobedience many people were made sinners, so also through one man's obedience many people will be made righteous."},{"number":20,"verse":"Now the Law crept in so that the offense would increase.
