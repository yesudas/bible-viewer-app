That's how Jehoram's son Ahaziah became king of Judah."},{"number":2,"verse":"Ahaziah was 22 {Cf. 2 King 8:26, Syr, and LXX. MT reads 42.} years old when he became king, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, Omri's granddaughter."},{"number":3,"verse":"He followed the example {Lit. footsteps} of Ahab's dynasty because his mother gave him evil counsel."},{"number":4,"verse":"So he practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, just like Ahab's dynasty had done, because after his father died, he was given advice that resulted in his destruction."},{"number":5,"verse":"He followed their counsel and accompanied Ahab's son Joram, king of Israel, to wage war against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram,"},{"number":6,"verse":"so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that he had received at Ramah in the battle against King Hazael of Aram.
