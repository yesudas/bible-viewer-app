As it is with the good person, so also it is with the sinner; as it is with someone who takes an oath, so also it is with someone who fears taking an oath."},{"number":3,"verse":"{The Universality of Death} d There is a tragedy that infects everything that happens on earth: a common event happens to everyone. In fact, the hearts of human beings are full of evil. Madness remains in their hearts while they live, and afterwards they join the dead."},{"number":4,"verse":"\"While someone is among the living, hope remains,\"because \"it is better to be a living dog than to be a dead lion.\" {These are ancient proverbs.}"},{"number":5,"verse":"At least the living know they will die, but the dead know nothing; they no longer have a reward, since memory about them has been forgotten."},{"number":6,"verse":"Furthermore, their love, their hate, and their envy have been long lost.
