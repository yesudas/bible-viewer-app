Judean leaders; lit. the Jews} became jealous, and they took some contemptible characters who used to hang out in the public square, {Or in the marketplace} formed a mob, and started a riot in the city. They attacked Jason's home and searched it for Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the people."},{"number":6,"verse":"When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials and shouted, \"These fellows who have turned the world upside down have come here, too,"},{"number":7,"verse":"and Jason has welcomed them as his guests. All of them oppose the emperor's decrees by saying that there is another king Jesus!\""},{"number":8,"verse":"The crowd and the city officials were upset when they heard this,"},{"number":9,"verse":"but after they had gotten a bond from Jason and the others, they let them go."},{"number":10,"verse":"{Paul and Silas in Berea} d That night the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away to Berea.

Some asked, \"What is this blabbermouth trying to say?\" while others said, \"He seems to be preaching about foreign gods.\" This was because Paul {Lit. because he} was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection."},{"number":19,"verse":"Then they took him, brought him before the Areopagus, {I. e. the city council} and asked, \"May we know what this new teaching of yours is?"},{"number":20,"verse":"It sounds rather strange to our ears, and we would like to know what it means.\""},{"number":21,"verse":"Now all the Athenians and the foreigners living there used to spend their time doing nothing else other than listening to the latest ideas or repeating them."},{"number":22,"verse":"So Paul stood up in front of the Areopagus {I. e. the city council} and said, \"Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every way."},{"number":23,"verse":"For as I was walking around and looking closely at the objects you worship, I even found an altar with this written on it: «To an unknown god.'So I am telling you about the unknown object you worship."},{"number":24,"verse":"The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth. He doesn't live in shrines made by human hands,"},{"number":25,"verse":"and he isn't served by people {Lit. hands} as if he needed anything.

Of course, he is never far from any one of us."},{"number":28,"verse":"For we live, move, and exist because of him, as some of your own poets have said: «For we are his children, too.'{Phainomena (5) by Aratus, a poet of Sicilian origin (3 rd century BC). Cleanthes the Stoic (3 rd century BC) used almost identical language.}"},{"number":29,"verse":"So if we are God's children, we shouldn't think that the divine being is like gold, silver, or stone, or is an image carved by humans using their own imagination and skill."},{"number":30,"verse":"Though God has overlooked those times of ignorance, he now commands everyone everywhere to repent,"},{"number":31,"verse":"because he has set a day when he is going to judge the world with justice {Or in righteousness} through a man whom he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.\""},{"number":32,"verse":"When they heard about a resurrection of the dead, some began joking about it, while others said, \"We will hear you again about this.\""},{"number":33,"verse":"And so Paul left the meeting. {Lit. went out from the middle of them}"},{"number":34,"verse":"Some men joined him and became believers.
