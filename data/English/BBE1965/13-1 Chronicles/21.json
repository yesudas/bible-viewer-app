So Joab went out and went through all Israel and came to Jerusalem."},{"number":5,"verse":"And Joab gave David the number of all the people; all the men of Israel, able to take up arms, were one million, one hundred thousand men; and those of Judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men, able to take up arms."},{"number":6,"verse":"But Levi and Benjamin were not numbered among them, for Joab was disgusted with the king's order."},{"number":7,"verse":"And God was not pleased with this thing; so he sent punishment on Israel."},{"number":8,"verse":"Then David said to God, Great has been my sin in doing this; but now, be pleased to take away the sin of your servant, for I have done very foolishly."},{"number":9,"verse":"Then the word of the Lord came to Gad, David's seer, saying,"},{"number":10,"verse":"Go and say to David, The Lord says, Three things are offered to you: say which of them you will have, so that I may do it to you."},{"number":11,"verse":"So Gad came to David and said to him, The Lord says, Take whichever you will:"},{"number":12,"verse":"Three years when there will not be enough food; or three months of war, when you will go in flight before your haters, being in great danger of the sword; or three days of the sword of the Lord, disease in the land, and the angel of the Lord taking destruction through all the land of Israel.
