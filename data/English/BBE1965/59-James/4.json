Every man desiring to be a friend of this world makes himself a hater of God."},{"number":5,"verse":"Or does it seem to you that it is for nothing that the holy Writings say, The spirit which God put into our hearts has a strong desire for us?"},{"number":6,"verse":"But he gives more grace. So that the Writings say, God is against the men of pride, but he gives grace to those who make themselves low before him."},{"number":7,"verse":"For this cause be ruled by God; but make war on the Evil One and he will be put to flight before you."},{"number":8,"verse":"Come near to God and he will come near to you.

What is your life? It is a mist, which is seen for a little time and then is gone."},{"number":15,"verse":"But the right thing to say would be, If it is the Lord's pleasure and if we are still living, we will do this and that."},{"number":16,"verse":"But now you go on glorying in your pride: and all such glorying is evil."},{"number":17,"verse":"The man who has knowledge of how to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin."}]}
