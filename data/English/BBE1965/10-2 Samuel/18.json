And the king said to the people, And I myself will certainly go out with you."},{"number":3,"verse":"But the people said, It is better for you not to go out: for if we are put to flight, they will not give a thought to us, and if death overtakes half of us, it will be nothing to them: but you are of more value than ten thousand of us: so it is better for you to be ready to come to our help from this town."},{"number":4,"verse":"And the king said to them, I will do whatever seems best to you. So the king took his place by the door of the town, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands."},{"number":5,"verse":"And the king gave orders to Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Because of me, be gentle to the young man Absalom.

And the Cushite, making a sign of respect to Joab, went off running."},{"number":22,"verse":"Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said to Joab again, Whatever may come of it, let me go after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why have you a desire to go, my son, seeing that you will get no reward for your news?"},{"number":23,"verse":"Whatever may come of it, he said, I will go. Then he said to him, Go. So Ahimaaz went running by the lowland road and overtook the Cushite."},{"number":24,"verse":"Now David was seated between the two town doors; and the watchman went up to the roof of the doorways, on the wall, and, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running by himself."},{"number":25,"verse":"And the watchman gave news of it to the king.

And the man was travelling quickly, and came near."},{"number":26,"verse":"Then the watchman saw another man running: and crying out in the direction of the door he said, Here is another man running by himself. And the king said, He, like the other, comes with news."},{"number":27,"verse":"And the watchman said, It seems to me that the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and his news will be good."},{"number":28,"verse":"And Ahimaaz, crying out to the king, said, It is well. And falling down before the king, with his face to the earth, he said, May the Lord your God be praised, who has given up the men who took up arms against my lord the king!"},{"number":29,"verse":"And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz said in answer, When Joab sent me, your servant, I saw a great outcry going on, but I had no knowledge of what it was."},{"number":30,"verse":"And the king said, Get back and take your place here. So turning to one side, he took his place there."},{"number":31,"verse":"And then the Cushite came and said, I have news for my lord the king: today the Lord has done right in your cause against all those who took up arms against you."},{"number":32,"verse":"And the king said to the Cushite, Is the young man Absalom safe? And the Cushite said in answer, May all the king's haters and those who do evil against the king, be as that young man is!"},{"number":33,"verse":"Then the king was much moved, and went up into the room over the door, weeping, and saying, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! if only my life might have been given for yours, O Absalom, my son, my son!"}]}
