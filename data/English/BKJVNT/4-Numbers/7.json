If You do these things, show Yourself to the world.\""},{"number":5,"verse":"You see, neither were His brothers trusting in Him."},{"number":6,"verse":"So Jesus says to them, \"The right time, the right time for Me, is not beside Me yet, but the right time, the right time for you, is always ready."},{"number":7,"verse":"The world is not able to be hating you, but it hates Me because I tell what I witness about it, that its actions are evil."},{"number":8,"verse":"You all walk up to this festival.

Who is looking to kill You?\""},{"number":21,"verse":"Jesus answered and said to them, \"I did one action, and everyone is amazed"},{"number":22,"verse":"because of this.
