So the first person who climbed in after the agitation of the water became well of whatever ill he was steadily having."},{"number":5,"verse":"A certain person was there having thirty and eight years in his weakness."},{"number":6,"verse":"When Jesus sees this person lying down and knows that he already has a lot of time there, He says to him, \"Do you want to become well?\""},{"number":7,"verse":"The person who was weak answered him, \"Master, I don't have a person so that when the water is agitated he may throw me into the swimming pool. But in the time that I am going, another person steps down before me.\""},{"number":8,"verse":"Jesus says to him, \"Get up.

You wanted to be excited close to an hour in his light."},{"number":36,"verse":"But I have the witness account greater than John's.
