You see, God has taken him in."},{"number":4,"verse":"Who are you, the one judging a domestic servant belonging to others? To his own master he stands or falls. He will be established. You see, God is able to establish him."},{"number":5,"verse":"There is one person who judges a day beyond another day, another who judges every day. Each person must be well-established in his own way of thinking."},{"number":6,"verse":"The person who focuses on the day, focuses on it with the Master; and the person who is not focusing on the day, is with the Master as he is not focusing. The person who eats, eats with the Master (you see, he thanks God); and the person who isn't eating, is with the Master as he isn't eating (he also thanks God)."},{"number":7,"verse":"You see, not one of us lives by himself, and not one dies by himself;"},{"number":8,"verse":"for both if we live, we live with the Master, and if we die, we die with the Master.

To that person it is shared."},{"number":15,"verse":"If because of food your brother is sad, you no longer traipse around in line with love.

Everything that is not from trust is sin."}]}
