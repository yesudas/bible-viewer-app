You see, I will come to sightings and uncoverings of the Master."},{"number":2,"verse":"I know a person in the Anointed King fourteen years ago (whether in a body, I don't know, or outside of the body, I don't know, God knows) after this type of person was snatched up to the third heaven."},{"number":3,"verse":"And I know this type of person (whether in a body or outside of the body, I don't know, God knows)"},{"number":4,"verse":"that he was snatched up into the paradise and heard inexpressible statements that a person is not permitted to speak."},{"number":5,"verse":"On behalf of this type of person I will brag, but on my own behalf I won't brag except in my weaknesses."},{"number":6,"verse":"You see, though I might want to brag, I won't be distracted; for I will state the truth. I am going easy on you that no one might consider anything to me above what he sees me to be or something he hears from me."},{"number":7,"verse":"And with the superiority of the uncoverings (so that I may not be raised too far up), an impaling stake to the physical body, an announcer of an opponent, was given to me so that it may slug me, so that I may not be raised too far up."},{"number":8,"verse":"On behalf of this, three times I encouraged the Master so that it might stay away from me,"},{"number":9,"verse":"and He has stated to me, \"My generosity is enough for you.
