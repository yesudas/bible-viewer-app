Do we still have a need for witnesses?"},{"number":64,"verse":"You listened to the hurtful comment. How does it appear to you?\" The men all found Him guilty to be confined for death."},{"number":65,"verse":"And some began to be spitting at Him, to be blindfolding His face, to be slugging Him, and to be saying to Him, \"Prophesy.\" And the rowers were taking Him with slaps."},{"number":66,"verse":"And as Peter is in the courtyard below, one of the servant girls of the head priest comes."},{"number":67,"verse":"And when she sees Peter warming himself, after looking at him, she says, \"You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.\""},{"number":68,"verse":"But Peter denied it, saying, \"I do not know nor am even aware of what you are saying.\" And he went outside into the front yard, and a rooster crowed."},{"number":69,"verse":"And when the servant girl saw him again, she began to be saying to the people who had stood nearby, \"This person is from them.\""},{"number":70,"verse":"But Peter again was denying it. And again after a little while, the people who had stood nearby were saying to Peter, \"You are truly from them. You see, you are even a Galilean, and your speech is similar.\""},{"number":71,"verse":"But Peter began to be vowing under the penalty of being doomed and to be guaranteeing, \"I do not know this person whom you are saying.\""},{"number":72,"verse":"And from a second time a rooster crowed, and Peter was reminded again of the statement that Jesus said to him, \"Before the time for a rooster to crow twice, three times you will flatly deny Me.\" And when he tossed it over in his mind, he was crying."}]}
