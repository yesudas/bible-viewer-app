And His generosity, the generosity for me, didn't become meaningless, but I labored much more than they all, not I, but the generosity of God, the generosity together with me."},{"number":11,"verse":"So whether I or those missionaries, this is how we speak publicly, and this is how you trusted."},{"number":12,"verse":"If the Anointed King is publicly spoken about, that He has been gotten up from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no return back to life of dead people?"},{"number":13,"verse":"If there is no return back to life of dead people, neither has the Anointed King been gotten up."},{"number":14,"verse":"If the Anointed King hasn't been gotten up, clearly our public speaking is meaningless.
