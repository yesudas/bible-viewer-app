Have I not seen Jesus, the Anointed King, our Master? Are you not my work in the Master?"},{"number":2,"verse":"If I am not a missionary to others, still I definitely am to you. You see, you (in the Master) are the seal of my mission."},{"number":3,"verse":"My defense to the people investigating me is this."},{"number":4,"verse":"Do we not in any way have authority to eat and drink?"},{"number":5,"verse":"Don't we in any way have authority to be leading around a sister, a wife, even as the rest of the missionaries, the brothers of the Master, and Cephas (Aramaic for Peter)?"},{"number":6,"verse":"Or do only I and Barnabas not have authority of the \"to not be working\" kind?"},{"number":7,"verse":"Who serves in the military at any time paying his own wages? Who plants a vineyard and doesn't eat from its fruit?

Or doesn't the law also say these things?"},{"number":9,"verse":"You see, it has been written in Moses' law, (in Deuteronomy 25:4) \"You won't muzzle a cow processing grain.\" God doesn't care for the cows, does He?"},{"number":10,"verse":"Or does He say it by all means because of us?

I didn't write these things so that it might become like this in me. You see, it is nice for me instead to die, than that someone would make my bragging meaningless."},{"number":16,"verse":"You see, if I share good news, to me it isn't something to brag about; for an obligation is lying on me. What a tragedy it is to me if I don't share good news;"},{"number":17,"verse":"for if I constantly do this thing voluntarily, I get pay, but if not voluntarily, I have been trusted with management."},{"number":18,"verse":"So what is the pay to me? That as I share good news, I might place the good news of the Anointed King without cost (for the \"for my authority in the good news not to be overused\" part)."},{"number":19,"verse":"You see, being free from all people, to all people I enslaved myself so that I might gain the majority of people."},{"number":20,"verse":"And to the Jewish people, I became as a Jewish person so that I might gain Jewish people.

So those people certainly restrain themselves so that they might receive a deteriorating award wreath, but we, an undeteriorating award wreath."},{"number":26,"verse":"Now then, this is how I run, not obscurely. This is how I box, not as if I am beating the air."},{"number":27,"verse":"But I give my body a black eye and lead it as a slave, that somehow, after speaking publicly to others, I might not become unapproved myself."}]}
