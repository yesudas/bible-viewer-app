But I don't even investigate myself"},{"number":4,"verse":"(you see, I have come to realize nothing by myself, but in this I haven't been made right). The One who investigates me is the Master."},{"number":5,"verse":"In such a way, don't judge anything before the appointed time until the Master comes, who also will illuminate the hidden things of the darkness and show the intentions of the hearts. And at that time, the high praise will happen to each person out from God."},{"number":6,"verse":"But these things, brothers, I refashion into myself and Apollos because of you, so that in us you might learn the \"not to focus above what has been written\" thing, so that not one of you may be conceited on behalf of the one person, against the different person."},{"number":7,"verse":"You see, who is considering you to be wrong? What do you have that you didn't receive? If you also received it, why do you brag as someone who didn't receive it?"},{"number":8,"verse":"Are you people who have already been stuffed?
