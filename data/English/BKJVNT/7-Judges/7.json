Likewise, the husband also doesn't have authority over his own body, but the wife does."},{"number":5,"verse":"Don't rob each of the other unless it is from a harmonious decision toward a certain time, so that you may hang out for the time of going without food and the prayer and you may come together again based on the same harmonious decision, so that the Opponent may not trouble you because of your lack of restraint."},{"number":6,"verse":"This I say in line with a suggestion, not in line with a directive."},{"number":7,"verse":"You see, I want all people to be even as I myself am. But each person has his own gift from God: one that certainly is like this, but another that is like this."},{"number":8,"verse":"I say to the unmarried and to the widows, \"It is nice for them if they stay even as I am."},{"number":9,"verse":"But if they are not restraining themselves, they must marry.\" You see, it is better to marry than to be inflamed with lust."},{"number":10,"verse":"I pass the order on (not I, but the Master) to the people who have married: for a wife not to be separated away from a husband"},{"number":11,"verse":"(if she actually is separated, she must stay unmarried or be restored to her husband), and for a husband not to be leaving a wife."},{"number":12,"verse":"To the rest, I say (I, not the Master), \"If any brother has an untrusting wife and she agrees that it is good to be having a house with him, he must not be leaving her."},{"number":13,"verse":"And a wife, someone who has an untrusting husband and he agrees it is good to be having a house with her, she must not be leaving him.\""},{"number":14,"verse":"You see, the husband, the untrusting one, has been made sacred in the wife, and the wife, the untrusting one, has been made sacred in the husband, or else clearly your children are not clean. But now they are sacred."},{"number":15,"verse":"If the untrusting person separates, he must be separated. The brother or the sister hasn't been enslaved in these types of situations. God has invited us in peace."},{"number":16,"verse":"You see, how do you know, wife, if you will rescue your husband? Or how do you know, husband, if you will rescue your wife?"},{"number":17,"verse":"If not, as God divided out to each person, as the Master has invited each person, this is how he must traipse around. And this is how I specifically arrange it in all the assemblies."},{"number":18,"verse":"Was anyone invited having been circumcised? He must not put a foreskin back on. Was anyone invited in uncircumcision? He must not be circumcised."},{"number":19,"verse":"The circumcision is nothing, and the uncircumcision is nothing, but what is something is the keeping of God's demands."},{"number":20,"verse":"Each person in the invitation with which he was invited, in this he must stay."},{"number":21,"verse":"Were you invited as a slave? It must not be a concern to you. But if you also are able to become free instead, use it."},{"number":22,"verse":"You see, the slave who was invited in the Master is a freed slave of the Master.

Don't look for a release. Have you been released from a wife? Don't look for a wife."},{"number":28,"verse":"But even if you married, you didn't sin, and if the virgin married, she didn't sin. These types of people will have hard times in the physical body. I am making it easy for you."},{"number":29,"verse":"I declare this, brothers, because the appointed time is a thing that has been wrapping up, so that for the rest of the time, even the people who have wives should be as the people who don't have wives."},{"number":30,"verse":"And the people crying should be as people not crying. And the people being happy should be as people not being happy. And the people buying should be as people not steadily having anything."},{"number":31,"verse":"And the people using this world should be as people not overusing it. You see, the entity of this world is passing on by."},{"number":32,"verse":"I want you to be without worries.

He isn't sinning. They must marry."},{"number":37,"verse":"A person who has stood in his heart, stable, not having an obligation, but has authority concerning his own thing that he wants, and has decided this in his own heart, to be keeping his own virgin daughter, does nicely."},{"number":38,"verse":"In such a way, even the person who gives her out in marriage does nicely, but the person who doesn't give her out in marriage does better."},{"number":39,"verse":"A wife has been tied up by the law over as much time as her husband lives, but if her husband fell asleep, she is free to be married to whom she wants, only in the Master."},{"number":40,"verse":"But she is more blessed if she stays like this, in line with my opinion.
