You see, the person preaching is greater than the person speaking with languages, outside of except he thoroughly interprets, so that the assembly might receive construction."},{"number":6,"verse":"Brothers, if I come to you right now speaking with languages, how will I benefit you if I don't speak to you either in the thing uncovered to me, or in information, or in preaching, or in a teaching?"},{"number":7,"verse":"In the same manner, the soulless things that give off a sound, whether a flute or a harp, if it didn't give a difference to the notes, how will it be known what is played on the flute or what is played on the harp?"},{"number":8,"verse":"You see, if a trumpet also gave an obscure sound, who will prepare for war?"},{"number":9,"verse":"In this way, you also through the language, if you don't give a clear message, how will it be known what is spoken?

When you come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a language, has the thing uncovered to him, has an interpretation. Everything must happen toward construction."},{"number":27,"verse":"If someone speaks with a language, it must be by two, or at the most three, and one part apiece.
