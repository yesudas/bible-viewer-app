First thing in the morning, be there for us! When things go bad, help us out!"},{"number":3,"verse":"You spoke in thunder and everyone ran. You showed up and nations scattered."},{"number":4,"verse":"Your people, for a change, got in on the loot, picking the field clean of the enemy spoils."},{"number":5,"verse":"GOD is supremely esteemed. His center holds. Zion brims over with all that is just and right."},{"number":6,"verse":"GOD keeps your days stable and secure-- salvation, wisdom, and knowledge in surplus, and best of all, Zion's treasure, Fear-of-GOD."},{"number":7,"verse":"But look! Listen! Tough men weep openly. Peacemaking diplomats are in bitter tears."},{"number":8,"verse":"The roads are empty-- not a soul out on the streets. The peace treaty is broken, its conditions violated, its signers reviled."},{"number":9,"verse":"The very ground under our feet mourns, the Lebanon mountains hang their heads, Flowering Sharon is a weed-choked gully, and the forests of Bashan and Carmel? Bare branches."},{"number":10,"verse":"\"Now I'm stepping in,\" GOD says. \"From now on, I'm taking over. The gloves come off. Now see how mighty I am."},{"number":11,"verse":"There's nothing to you.

Who of us can get out of this purge with our lives?'\""},{"number":15,"verse":"The answer's simple: Live right, speak the truth, despise exploitation, refuse bribes, reject violence, avoid evil amusements."},{"number":16,"verse":"This is how you raise your standard of living!

And you'll take in the wide vistas of land."},{"number":18,"verse":"In your mind you'll go over the old terrors: \"What happened to that Assyrian inspector who condemned and confiscated? And the one who gouged us of taxes? And that cheating moneychanger?\""},{"number":19,"verse":"Gone! Out of sight forever! Their insolence nothing now but a fading stain on the carpet! No more putting up with a language you can't understand, no more sounds of gibberish in your ears."},{"number":20,"verse":"Just take a look at Zion, will you? Centering our worship in festival feasts! Feast your eyes on Jerusalem, a quiet and permanent place to live. No more pulling up stakes and moving on, no more patched-together lean-tos."},{"number":21,"verse":"Instead, GOD! GOD majestic, God himself the place in a country of broad rivers and streams, But rivers blocked to invading ships, off-limits to predatory pirates."},{"number":22,"verse":"For GOD makes all the decisions here. GOD is our king. GOD runs this place and he'll keep us safe."},{"number":23,"verse":"Ha! Your sails are in shreds, your mast wobbling, your hold leaking. The plunder is free for the taking, free for all-- for weak and strong, insiders and outsiders."},{"number":24,"verse":"No one in Zion will say, \"I'm sick.\" Best of all, they'll all live guilt-free."}]}
