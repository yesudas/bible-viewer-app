Earth, you too, and everything in you. World, and all that comes from you."},{"number":2,"verse":"And here's why: GOD is angry, good and angry with all the nations, So blazingly angry at their arms and armies that he's going to rid earth of them, wipe them out."},{"number":3,"verse":"The corpses, thrown in a heap, will stink like the town dump in midsummer, Their blood flowing off the mountains like creeks in spring runoff."},{"number":4,"verse":"Stars will fall out of the sky like overripe, rotting fruit in the orchard, And the sky itself will be folded up like a blanket and put away in a closet. All that army of stars, shriveled to nothing, like leaves and fruit in autumn, dropping and rotting!"},{"number":5,"verse":"\"Once I've finished with earth and sky, I'll start in on Edom. I'll come down hard on Edom, a people I've slated for total termination.\""},{"number":6,"verse":"GOD has a sword, thirsty for blood and more blood, a sword hungry for well-fed flesh, Lamb and goat blood, the suet-rich kidneys of rams. Yes, GOD has scheduled a sacrifice in Bozrah, the capital, the whole country of Edom a slaughterhouse."},{"number":7,"verse":"A wholesale slaughter, wild animals and farm animals alike slaughtered.

They'll name it No Kingdom There, A country where all kings and princes are unemployed."},{"number":13,"verse":"Thistles will take over, covering the castles, fortresses conquered by weeds and thornbushes. Wild dogs will prowl the ruins, ostriches have the run of the place."},{"number":14,"verse":"Wildcats and hyenas will hunt together, demons and devils dance through the night. The night-demon Lilith, evil and rapacious, will establish permanent quarters."},{"number":15,"verse":"Scavenging carrion birds will breed and brood, infestations of ominous evil."},{"number":16,"verse":"Get and read GOD's book: None of this is going away, this breeding, brooding evil.

This is permanent-- generation after generation, the same old thing."}]}
