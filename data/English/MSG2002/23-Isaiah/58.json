Tell my people what's wrong with their lives, face my family Jacob with their sins!"},{"number":2,"verse":"They're busy, busy, busy at worship, and love studying all about me. To all appearances they're a nation of right-living people-- law-abiding, God-honoring. They ask me, 'What's the right thing to do?' and love having me on their side."},{"number":3,"verse":"But they also complain, 'Why do we fast and you don't look our way?
