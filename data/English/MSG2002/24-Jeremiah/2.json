Anyone who laid a hand on her would soon wish he hadn't!'\" GOD's Decree."},{"number":4,"verse":"Hear GOD's Message, House of Jacob! Yes, you--House of Israel!"},{"number":5,"verse":"GOD's Message: \"What did your ancestors find fault with in me that they drifted so far from me, Took up with Sir Windbag and turned into windbags themselves?"},{"number":6,"verse":"It never occurred to them to say, 'Where's GOD, the God who got us out of Egypt, Who took care of us through thick and thin, those rough-and-tumble wilderness years of parched deserts and death valleys, A land that no one who enters comes out of, a cruel, inhospitable land?'"},{"number":7,"verse":"\"I brought you to a garden land where you could eat lush fruit. But you barged in and polluted my land, trashed and defiled my dear land."},{"number":8,"verse":"The priests never thought to ask, 'Where's GOD?' The religion experts knew nothing of me.

Isn't it because you walked out on your God just as he was beginning to lead you in the right way?"},{"number":18,"verse":"\"And now, what do you think you'll get by going off to Egypt? Maybe a cool drink of Nile River water? Or what do you think you'll get by going off to Assyria?

Well, look at the tracks you've left behind in the valley. How do you account for what is written in the desert dust-- Tracks of a camel in heat, running this way and that,"},{"number":24,"verse":"tracks of a wild donkey in rut, Sniffing the wind for the slightest scent of sex. Who could possibly corral her! On the hunt for sex, sex, and more sex-- insatiable, indiscriminate, promiscuous."},{"number":25,"verse":"\"Slow down. Take a deep breath. What's the hurry? Why wear yourself out? Just what are you after anyway? But you say, 'I can't help it. I'm addicted to alien gods. I can't quit.'"},{"number":26,"verse":"\"Just as a thief is chagrined, but only when caught, so the people of Israel are chagrined, Caught along with their kings and princes, their priests and prophets."},{"number":27,"verse":"They walk up to a tree and say, 'My father!' They pick up a stone and say, 'My mother! You bore me!' All I ever see of them is their backsides. They never look me in the face.

From now on we're on our own'?"},{"number":32,"verse":"Young women don't forget their jewelry, do they? Brides don't show up without their veils, do they? But my people forget me. Day after day after day they never give me a thought."},{"number":33,"verse":"\"What an impressive start you made to get the most out of life. You founded schools of sin, taught graduate courses in evil!"},{"number":34,"verse":"And now you're sending out graduates, resplendent in cap and gown-- except the gowns are stained with the blood of your victims!
