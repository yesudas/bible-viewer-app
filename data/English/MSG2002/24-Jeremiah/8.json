The bones will be left scattered and exposed, to reenter the soil as fertilizer, like manure."},{"number":3,"verse":"\"Everyone left--all from this evil generation unlucky enough to still be alive in whatever godforsaken place I will have driven them to--will wish they were dead.\" Decree of GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies."},{"number":4,"verse":"\"Tell them this, GOD's Message: \"'Do people fall down and not get up?

You'll be just fine.\" But things are not \"just fine\"!"},{"number":12,"verse":"Do you suppose they are embarrassed over this outrage? Not really. They have no shame.
