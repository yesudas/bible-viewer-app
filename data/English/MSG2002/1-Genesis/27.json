As soon as Esau had gone off to the country to hunt game for his father,"},{"number":6,"verse":"Rebekah spoke to her son Jacob. \"I just overheard your father talking with your brother, Esau. He said,"},{"number":7,"verse":"'Bring me some game and fix me a hearty meal so that I can eat and bless you with GOD's blessing before I die.'"},{"number":8,"verse":"\"Now, my son, listen to me.

I did what you told me. Come now; sit up and eat of my game so you can give me your personal blessing.\""},{"number":20,"verse":"Isaac said, \"So soon? How did you get it so quickly?\" \"Because your GOD cleared the way for me.\""},{"number":21,"verse":"Isaac said, \"Come close, son; let me touch you--are you really my son Esau?\""},{"number":22,"verse":"So Jacob moved close to his father Isaac. Isaac felt him and said, \"The voice is Jacob's voice but the hands are the hands of Esau.\""},{"number":23,"verse":"He didn't recognize him because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau's. But as he was about to bless him"},{"number":24,"verse":"he pressed him, \"You're sure? You are my son Esau?\" \"Yes. I am.\""},{"number":25,"verse":"Isaac said, \"Bring the food so I can eat of my son's game and give you my personal blessing.\" Jacob brought it to him and he ate.

He said, \"Then who hunted game and brought it to me? I finished the meal just now, before you walked in. And I blessed him--he's blessed for good!\""},{"number":34,"verse":"Esau, hearing his father's words, sobbed violently and most bitterly, and cried to his father, \"My father! Can't you also bless me?\""},{"number":35,"verse":"\"Your brother,\" he said, \"came here falsely and took your blessing.\""},{"number":36,"verse":"Esau said, \"Not for nothing was he named Jacob, the Heel. Twice now he's tricked me: first he took my birthright and now he's taken my blessing.\" He begged, \"Haven't you kept back any blessing for me?\""},{"number":37,"verse":"Isaac answered Esau, \"I've made him your master, and all his brothers his servants, and lavished grain and wine on him.

Run for your life to Haran, to my brother Laban."},{"number":44,"verse":"Live with him for a while until your brother cools down,"},{"number":45,"verse":"until his anger subsides and he forgets what you did to him. I'll then send for you and bring you back. Why should I lose both of you the same day?\""},{"number":46,"verse":"Rebekah spoke to Isaac, \"I'm sick to death of these Hittite women. If Jacob also marries a native Hittite woman, why live?\""}]}
