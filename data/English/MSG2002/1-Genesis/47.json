I'll trade you food for livestock since your money's run out.\""},{"number":17,"verse":"So they brought Joseph their livestock. He traded them food for their horses, sheep, cattle, and donkeys. He got them through that year in exchange for all their livestock."},{"number":18,"verse":"When that year was over, the next year rolled around and they were back, saying, \"Master, it's no secret to you that we're broke: our money's gone and we've traded you all our livestock. We've nothing left to barter with but our bodies and our farms."},{"number":19,"verse":"What use are our bodies and our land if we stand here and starve to death right in front of you? Trade us food for our bodies and our land. We'll be slaves to Pharaoh and give up our land--all we ask is seed for survival, just enough to live on and keep the farms alive.\""},{"number":20,"verse":"So Joseph bought up all the farms in Egypt for Pharaoh.

That's how Pharaoh ended up owning all the land"},{"number":21,"verse":"and the people ended up slaves; Joseph reduced the people to slavery from one end of Egypt to the other."},{"number":22,"verse":"Joseph made an exception for the priests. He didn't buy their land because they received a fixed salary from Pharaoh and were able to live off of that salary.

In exchange I'm giving you seed so you can plant the ground."},{"number":24,"verse":"When the crops are harvested, you must give a fifth to Pharaoh and keep four-fifths for yourselves, for seed for yourselves and your families--you're going to be able to feed your children!\""},{"number":25,"verse":"They said, \"You've saved our lives! Master, we're grateful and glad to be slaves to Pharaoh.\""},{"number":26,"verse":"Joseph decreed a land law in Egypt that is still in effect, A Fifth Goes to Pharaoh. Only the priests' lands were not owned by Pharaoh."},{"number":27,"verse":"And so Israel settled down in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property and flourished. They became a large company of people."},{"number":28,"verse":"Jacob lived in Egypt for seventeen years.

Don't bury me in Egypt."},{"number":30,"verse":"When I lie down with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me alongside them.\" \"I will,\" he said. \"I'll do what you've asked.\""},{"number":31,"verse":"Israel said, \"Promise me.\" Joseph promised.
