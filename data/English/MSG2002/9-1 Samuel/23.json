Meanwhile, David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the desert south of Jeshimon."},{"number":25,"verse":"Saul and his men arrived and began their search. When David heard of it, he went south to Rock Mountain, camping out in the wilderness of Maon. Saul heard where he was and set off for the wilderness of Maon in pursuit."},{"number":26,"verse":"Saul was on one side of the mountain, David and his men on the other.
