A crowd built up to such a great size that he had to get into an offshore boat, using the boat as a pulpit as the people pushed to the water's edge."},{"number":2,"verse":"He taught by using stories, many stories."},{"number":3,"verse":"\"Listen. What do you make of this? A farmer planted seed."},{"number":4,"verse":"As he scattered the seed, some of it fell on the road and birds ate it."},{"number":5,"verse":"Some fell in the gravel; it sprouted quickly but didn't put down roots,"},{"number":6,"verse":"so when the sun came up it withered just as quickly."},{"number":7,"verse":"Some fell in the weeds; as it came up, it was strangled among the weeds and nothing came of it."},{"number":8,"verse":"Some fell on good earth and came up with a flourish, producing a harvest exceeding his wildest dreams."},{"number":9,"verse":"\"Are you listening to this?

But to those who can't see it yet, everything comes in stories, creating readiness, nudging them toward receptive insight."},{"number":12,"verse":"These are people-- Whose eyes are open but don't see a thing, Whose ears are open but don't understand a word, Who avoid making an about-face and getting forgiven.\""},{"number":13,"verse":"He continued, \"Do you see how this story works? All my stories work this way."},{"number":14,"verse":"\"The farmer plants the Word."},{"number":15,"verse":"Some people are like the seed that falls on the hardened soil of the road.

Really listening?"},{"number":24,"verse":"\"Listen carefully to what I am saying--and be wary of the shrewd advice that tells you how to get ahead in the world on your own.

Stinginess impoverishes.\""},{"number":26,"verse":"Then Jesus said, \"God's kingdom is like seed thrown on a field by a man"},{"number":27,"verse":"who then goes to bed and forgets about it. The seed sprouts and grows--he has no idea how it happens."},{"number":28,"verse":"The earth does it all without his help: first a green stem of grass, then a bud, then the ripened grain."},{"number":29,"verse":"When the grain is fully formed, he reaps--harvest time!"},{"number":30,"verse":"\"How can we picture God's kingdom? What kind of story can we use?"},{"number":31,"verse":"It's like a pine nut.

They roused him, saying, \"Teacher, is it nothing to you that we're going down?\""},{"number":39,"verse":"Awake now, he told the wind to pipe down and said to the sea, \"Quiet! Settle down!\" The wind ran out of breath; the sea became smooth as glass."},{"number":40,"verse":"Jesus reprimanded the disciples: \"Why are you such cowards?
