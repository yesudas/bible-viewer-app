Wipe that ugly sneer off your own face, and you might be fit to offer a washcloth to your neighbor."},{"number":6,"verse":"\"Don't be flip with the sacred. Banter and silliness give no honor to God. Don't reduce holy mysteries to slogans. In trying to be relevant, you're only being cute and inviting sacrilege."},{"number":7,"verse":"\"Don't bargain with God. Be direct. Ask for what you need."},{"number":8,"verse":"This isn't a cat-and-mouse, hide-and-seek game we're in."},{"number":9,"verse":"If your child asks for bread, do you trick him with sawdust?"},{"number":10,"verse":"If he asks for fish, do you scare him with a live snake on his plate?"},{"number":11,"verse":"As bad as you are, you wouldn't think of such a thing.

Chances are they are out to rip you off some way or other. Don't be impressed with charisma; look for character."},{"number":16,"verse":"Who preachers are is the main thing, not what they say.
