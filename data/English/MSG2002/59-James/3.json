Teaching is highly responsible work. Teachers are held to the strictest standards."},{"number":2,"verse":"And none of us is perfectly qualified. We get it wrong nearly every time we open our mouths.

It only takes a spark, remember, to set off a forest fire."},{"number":6,"verse":"A careless or wrongly placed word out of your mouth can do that. By our speech we can ruin the world, turn harmony to chaos, throw mud on a reputation, send the whole world up in smoke and go up in smoke with it, smoke right from the pit of hell."},{"number":7,"verse":"This is scary: You can tame a tiger,"},{"number":8,"verse":"but you can't tame a tongue--it's never been done.
