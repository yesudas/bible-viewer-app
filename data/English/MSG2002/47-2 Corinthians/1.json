I write this to God's congregation in Corinth, and to believers all over Achaia province."},{"number":2,"verse":"May all the gifts and benefits that come from God our Father and the Master, Jesus Christ, be yours!

If we are treated well, given a helping hand and encouraging word, that also works to your benefit, spurring you on, face forward, unflinching. Your hard times are also our hard times."},{"number":7,"verse":"When we see that you're just as willing to endure the hard times as to enjoy the good times, we know you're going to make it, no doubt about it."},{"number":8,"verse":"We don't want you in the dark, friends, about how hard it was when all this came down on us in Asia province. It was so bad we didn't think we were going to make it."},{"number":9,"verse":"We felt like we'd been sent to death row, that it was all over for us.

But it wasn't by any fancy footwork on our part. It was God who kept us focused on him, uncompromised."},{"number":13,"verse":"Don't try to read between the lines or look for hidden meanings in this letter. We're writing plain, unembellished truth, hoping that"},{"number":14,"verse":"you'll now see the whole picture as well as you've seen some of the details. We want you to be as proud of us as we are of you when we stand together before our Master Jesus."},{"number":15,"verse":"Confident of your welcome, I had originally planned two great visits with you--"},{"number":16,"verse":"coming by on my way to Macedonia province, and then again on my return trip. Then we could have had a bon-voyage party as you sent me off to Judea. That was the plan."},{"number":17,"verse":"Are you now going to accuse me of being flip with my promises because it didn't work out? Do you think I talk out of both sides of my mouth--a glib yes one moment, a glib no the next?"},{"number":18,"verse":"Well, you're wrong. I try to be as true to my word as God is to his.

As God is my witness, the only reason I didn't come was to spare you pain. I was being considerate of you, not indifferent, not manipulative."},{"number":24,"verse":"We're not in charge of how you live out the faith, looking over your shoulders, suspiciously critical. We're partners, working alongside you, joyfully expectant. I know that you stand by your own faith, not by ours."}]}
