Two-faced and double-tongued, they steal you blind, pick you clean."},{"number":2,"verse":"It never crosses their mind that I keep account of their every crime. They're mud-spattered head to toe with the residue of sin. I see who they are and what they've done."},{"number":3,"verse":"\"They entertain the king with their evil circus, delight the princes with their acrobatic lies."},{"number":4,"verse":"They're a bunch of overheated adulterers, like an oven that holds its heat From the kneading of the dough to the rising of the bread."},{"number":5,"verse":"On the royal holiday the princes get drunk on wine and the frenzy of the mocking mob."},{"number":6,"verse":"They're like wood stoves, red-hot with lust. Through the night their passion is banked; in the morning it blazes up, flames hungrily licking."},{"number":7,"verse":"Murderous and volcanic, they incinerate their rulers. Their kings fall one by one, and no one pays any attention to me."},{"number":8,"verse":"\"Ephraim mingles with the pagans, dissipating himself. Ephraim is half-baked."},{"number":9,"verse":"Strangers suck him dry but he doesn't even notice. His hair has turned gray-- he doesn't notice."},{"number":10,"verse":"Bloated by arrogance, big as a house, Israel's a public disgrace.

I'll clip their wings. I'll teach them to mind me!"},{"number":13,"verse":"Doom! They've run away from home. Now they're really in trouble! They've defied me. And I'm supposed to help them while they feed me a line of lies?"},{"number":14,"verse":"Instead of crying out to me in heartfelt prayer, they whoop it up in bed with their whores, Gash themselves bloody in their sex-and-religion orgies, but turn their backs on me."},{"number":15,"verse":"I'm the one who gave them good minds and healthy bodies, and how am I repaid? With evil scheming!"},{"number":16,"verse":"They turn, but not to me-- turn here, then there, like a weather vane. Their rulers will be cut down, murdered-- just deserts for their mocking blasphemies. And the final sentence? Ridicule in the court of world opinion."}]}
