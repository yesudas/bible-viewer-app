Head east and hide out at the Kerith Ravine on the other side of the Jordan River."},{"number":4,"verse":"You can drink fresh water from the brook; I've ordered the ravens to feed you.\""},{"number":5,"verse":"Elijah obeyed GOD's orders. He went and camped in the Kerith canyon on the other side of the Jordan."},{"number":6,"verse":"And sure enough, ravens brought him his meals, both breakfast and supper, and he drank from the brook."},{"number":7,"verse":"Eventually the brook dried up because of the drought."},{"number":8,"verse":"Then GOD spoke to him:"},{"number":9,"verse":"\"Get up and go to Zarephath in Sidon and live there. I've instructed a woman who lives there, a widow, to feed you.\""},{"number":10,"verse":"So he got up and went to Zarephath.

After we eat it, we'll die.\""},{"number":13,"verse":"Elijah said to her, \"Don't worry about a thing. Go ahead and do what you've said. But first make a small biscuit for me and bring it back here. Then go ahead and make a meal from what's left for you and your son."},{"number":14,"verse":"This is the word of the GOD of Israel: 'The jar of flour will not run out and the bottle of oil will not become empty before GOD sends rain on the land and ends this drought.'\""},{"number":15,"verse":"And she went right off and did it, did just as Elijah asked.
