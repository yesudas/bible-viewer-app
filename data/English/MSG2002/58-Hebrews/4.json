But not if we don't have faith. Remember that God said, Exasperated, I vowed, \"They'll never get where they're going, never be able to sit down and rest.\" God made that vow, even though he'd finished his part before the foundation of the world."},{"number":4,"verse":"Somewhere it's written, \"God rested the seventh day, having completed his work,\""},{"number":5,"verse":"but in this other text he says, \"They'll never be able to sit down and rest.\""},{"number":6,"verse":"So this promise has not yet been fulfilled. Those earlier ones never did get to the place of rest because they were disobedient."},{"number":7,"verse":"God keeps renewing the promise and setting the date as today, just as he did in David's psalm, centuries later than the original invitation: Today, please listen, don't turn a deaf ear . . ."},{"number":8,"verse":"And so this is still a live promise.

What he says goes. His powerful Word is sharp as a surgeon's scalpel, cutting through everything, whether doubt or defense, laying us open to listen and obey."},{"number":13,"verse":"Nothing and no one is impervious to God's Word. We can't get away from it--no matter what."},{"number":14,"verse":"Now that we know what we have--Jesus, this great High Priest with ready access to God--let's not let it slip through our fingers."},{"number":15,"verse":"We don't have a priest who is out of touch with our reality. He's been through weakness and testing, experienced it all--all but the sin."},{"number":16,"verse":"So let's walk right up to him and get what he is so ready to give. Take the mercy, accept the help."}]}
