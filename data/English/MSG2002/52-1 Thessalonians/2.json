We were sure of ourselves in God, and went right ahead and said our piece, presenting God's Message to you, defiant of the opposition."},{"number":3,"verse":"God tested us thoroughly to make sure we were qualified to be trusted with this Message."},{"number":4,"verse":"Be assured that when we speak to you we're not after crowd approval--only God approval. Since we've been put through that battery of tests, you're guaranteed that both we and the Message are free of error, mixed motives, or hidden agendas."},{"number":5,"verse":"We never used words to butter you up.

When you got the Message of God we preached, you didn't pass it off as just one more human opinion, but you took it to heart as God's true word to you, which it is, God himself at work in you believers!"},{"number":14,"verse":"Friends, do you realize that you followed in the exact footsteps of the churches of God in Judea, those who were the first to follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ? You got the same bad treatment from your countrymen as they did from theirs, the Jews"},{"number":15,"verse":"who killed the Master Jesus (to say nothing of the prophets) and followed it up by running us out of town. They make themselves offensive to God and everyone else"},{"number":16,"verse":"by trying to keep us from telling people who've never heard of our God how to be saved. They've made a career of opposing God, and have gotten mighty good at it. But God is fed up, ready to put an end to it."},{"number":17,"verse":"Do you have any idea how very homesick we became for you, dear friends? Even though it hadn't been that long and it was only our bodies that were separated from you, not our hearts, we tried our very best to get back to see you."},{"number":18,"verse":"You can't imagine how much we missed you!
