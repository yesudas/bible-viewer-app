Pilate announced, \"Here he is: the Man.\""},{"number":6,"verse":"When the high priests and police saw him, they shouted in a frenzy, \"Crucify! Crucify!\" Pilate told them, \"You take him.

Blood and water gushed out."},{"number":35,"verse":"The eyewitness to these things has presented an accurate report. He saw it himself and is telling the truth so that you, also, will believe."},{"number":36,"verse":"These things that happened confirmed the Scripture, \"Not a bone in his body was broken,\""},{"number":37,"verse":"and the other Scripture that reads, \"They will stare at the one they pierced.\""},{"number":38,"verse":"After all this, Joseph of Arimathea (he was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, because he was intimidated by the Jews) petitioned Pilate to take the body of Jesus.
