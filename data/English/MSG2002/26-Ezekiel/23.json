She lusted after Assyrians as lovers: military men"},{"number":6,"verse":"smartly uniformed in blue, ambassadors and governors, good-looking young men mounted on fine horses."},{"number":7,"verse":"Her lust was unrestrained. She was a whore to the Assyrian elite. She compounded her filth with the idols of those to whom she gave herself in lust."},{"number":8,"verse":"She never slowed down.
