Assyria was a Big Tree, huge as a Lebanon cedar, beautiful limbs offering cool shade, Skyscraper high, piercing the clouds."},{"number":4,"verse":"The waters gave it drink, the primordial deep lifted it high, Gushing out rivers around the place where it was planted, And then branching out in streams to all the trees in the forest."},{"number":5,"verse":"It was immense, dwarfing all the trees in the forest-- Thick boughs, long limbs, roots delving deep into earth's waters."},{"number":6,"verse":"All the birds of the air nested in its boughs.
