Each had the form of a human being,"},{"number":6,"verse":"but each also had four faces and four wings."},{"number":7,"verse":"Their legs were as sturdy and straight as columns, but their feet were hoofed like those of a calf and sparkled from the fire like burnished bronze."},{"number":8,"verse":"On all four sides under their wings they had human hands. All four had both faces and wings,"},{"number":9,"verse":"with the wings touching one another. They turned neither one way nor the other; they went straight forward."},{"number":10,"verse":"Their faces looked like this: In front a human face, on the right side the face of a lion, on the left the face of an ox, and in back the face of an eagle."},{"number":11,"verse":"So much for the faces. The wings were spread out with the tips of one pair touching the creature on either side; the other pair of wings covered its body."},{"number":12,"verse":"Each creature went straight ahead.

It looked like they were wheels within wheels, like a gyroscope."},{"number":17,"verse":"They went in any one of the four directions they faced, but straight, not veering off."},{"number":18,"verse":"The rims were immense, circled with eyes."},{"number":19,"verse":"When the living creatures went, the wheels went; when the living creatures lifted off, the wheels lifted off."},{"number":20,"verse":"Wherever the spirit went, they went, the wheels sticking right with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."},{"number":21,"verse":"When the creatures went, the wheels went; when the creatures stopped, the wheels stopped; when the creatures lifted off, the wheels lifted off, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."},{"number":22,"verse":"Over the heads of the living creatures was something like a dome, shimmering like a sky full of cut glass, vaulted over their heads."},{"number":23,"verse":"Under the dome one set of wings was extended toward the others, with another set of wings covering their bodies."},{"number":24,"verse":"When they moved I heard their wings--it was like the roar of a great waterfall, like the voice of The Strong God, like the noise of a battlefield. When they stopped, they folded their wings."},{"number":25,"verse":"And then, as they stood with folded wings, there was a voice from above the dome over their heads."},{"number":26,"verse":"Above the dome there was something that looked like a throne, sky-blue like a sapphire, with a humanlike figure towering above the throne."},{"number":27,"verse":"From what I could see, from the waist up he looked like burnished bronze and from the waist down like a blazing fire.

When I saw all this, I fell to my knees, my face to the ground. Then I heard a voice."}]}
