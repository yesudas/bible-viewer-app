Protect me!'"},{"number":4,"verse":"\"He never gave her the time of day. But after this went on and on he said to himself, 'I care nothing what God thinks, even less what people think."},{"number":5,"verse":"But because this widow won't quit badgering me, I'd better do something and see that she gets justice--otherwise I'm going to end up beaten black and blue by her pounding.'\""},{"number":6,"verse":"Then the Master said, \"Do you hear what that judge, corrupt as he is, is saying?"},{"number":7,"verse":"So what makes you think God won't step in and work justice for his chosen people, who continue to cry out for help? Won't he stick up for them?"},{"number":8,"verse":"I assure you, he will. He will not drag his feet. But how much of that kind of persistent faith will the Son of Man find on the earth when he returns?\""},{"number":9,"verse":"He told his next story to some who were complacently pleased with themselves over their moral performance and looked down their noses at the common people:"},{"number":10,"verse":"\"Two men went up to the Temple to pray, one a Pharisee, the other a tax man."},{"number":11,"verse":"The Pharisee posed and prayed like this: 'Oh, God, I thank you that I am not like other people--robbers, crooks, adulterers, or, heaven forbid, like this tax man."},{"number":12,"verse":"I fast twice a week and tithe on all my income.'"},{"number":13,"verse":"\"Meanwhile the tax man, slumped in the shadows, his face in his hands, not daring to look up, said, 'God, give mercy. Forgive me, a sinner.'\""},{"number":14,"verse":"Jesus commented, \"This tax man, not the other, went home made right with God. If you walk around with your nose in the air, you're going to end up flat on your face, but if you're content to be simply yourself, you will become more than yourself.\""},{"number":15,"verse":"People brought babies to Jesus, hoping he might touch them. When the disciples saw it, they shooed them off."},{"number":16,"verse":"Jesus called them back. \"Let these children alone. Don't get between them and me. These children are the kingdom's pride and joy."},{"number":17,"verse":"Mark this: Unless you accept God's kingdom in the simplicity of a child, you'll never get in.\""},{"number":18,"verse":"One day one of the local officials asked him, \"Good Teacher, what must I do to deserve eternal life?\""},{"number":19,"verse":"Jesus said, \"Why are you calling me good? No one is good--only God."},{"number":20,"verse":"You know the commandments, don't you?

You will have riches in heaven. Then come, follow me.\""},{"number":23,"verse":"This was the last thing the official expected to hear. He was very rich and became terribly sad.

Every chance in the world if you trust God to do it.\""},{"number":28,"verse":"Peter tried to regain some initiative: \"We left everything we owned and followed you, didn't we?\""},{"number":29,"verse":"\"Yes,\" said Jesus, \"and you won't regret it. No one who has sacrificed home, spouse, brothers and sisters, parents, children--whatever--"},{"number":30,"verse":"will lose out. It will all come back multiplied many times over in your lifetime. And then the bonus of eternal life!\""},{"number":31,"verse":"Then Jesus took the Twelve off to the side and said, \"Listen carefully. We're on our way up to Jerusalem. Everything written in the Prophets about the Son of Man will take place."},{"number":32,"verse":"He will be handed over to the Romans, jeered at, made sport of, and spit on. Then, after giving him the third degree, they will kill him."},{"number":33,"verse":"In three days he will rise, alive.\""},{"number":34,"verse":"But they didn't get it, could make neither heads nor tails of what he was talking about."},{"number":35,"verse":"He came to the outskirts of Jericho. A blind man was sitting beside the road asking for handouts."},{"number":36,"verse":"When he heard the rustle of the crowd, he asked what was going on."},{"number":37,"verse":"They told him, \"Jesus the Nazarene is going by.\""},{"number":38,"verse":"He yelled, \"Jesus!
