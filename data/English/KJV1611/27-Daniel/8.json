hornes, and the two hornes were high: but one was higher then the other, and the higher came vp last."},{"number":4,"verse":"I saw the ramme pushing Westward, & Northward, and Southward: so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliuer out of his hand, but he did according to his will, and became great."},{"number":5,"verse":"And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came fro the west on the face of the whole earth, & touched not the ground: and the goate had a notable horne betweene his eyes."},{"number":6,"verse":"And he came to the ramme that had two
