So, saith he, doth it fare with us: for now we are joined to the spirit as it were to the second husband, by whom we must bring forth new children: we are dead in respect of the first husband, but in respect of the latter we are as it were raised from the dead.) So ye, my brethren, are dead also to the Law by the (That is, in the body of Christ, to give us to understand how straight and near that fellowship is betwixt Christ and his members.) body of Christ, that ye should be unto another, even unto him that is raised up from the dead, that we should bring forth (He calleth the children, which the wife hath by her husband, fruit.) fruit unto (Which are acceptable to God.)

But now since that husband is dead, and so consequently being delivered from the force of that killing law, we have passed into the governance of the spirit, so that we bring forth now, not those rotten and dead, but lively children.) For when we (When we were in the state of the first marriage, which he calleth in the next verse following the oldness of the letter.) were in the flesh, the (The motions that egged us to sin, which show their force even in our minds.) affections of sins, which were by the (He saith not, of the law, but by the law, because they spring of sin which dwelleth within us, and take occasion to work thus in us, by reason of the restraint that the law maketh, not that the fault is in the law, but in ourselves.) law, had (Wrought their strength.) force in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death,"},{"number":6,"verse":"But now we are delivered from the Law, he (As if he said, The bond which bound us, is dead, and vanished away, insomuch, that sin which held us, hath not now wherewith to hold us.) being dead (For this husband is within us.) in whom we were (Satan is an unjust possessor, for he brought us in bondage of sin and himself deceitfully: and yet notwithstanding so long as we are sinners, we sin willingly.) holden, that we should serve in (As becometh them, which after the death of their old husband are joined to the spirit: as whom the spirit of God hath made new men.) newness of Spirit, and not in the oldness of the (By the letter he meaneth the law, in respect of that old condition: for before that our will be framed by the holy Ghost, the law speaketh but to deaf men, and therefore it is dumb and dead to us, as touching the fulfilling of it.) letter."},{"number":7,"verse":"(An objection: what then? are the law and sin all one, and do they agree together? nay, saith he: Sin is reproved and condemned by the law. But because sin cannot abide to be reproved, and was not in a manner felt until it was provoked and stirred up by the law, it taketh occasion thereby to be more outrageous, and yet by no fault of the law.) What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? God forbid. Nay, I knew not sin, but by the Law: for I had not known (By the word, Lust, in this place he meaneth not evil lusts themselves, but the fountain from whence they spring: for the very heathen philosophers themselves condemned wicked lusts, though somewhat darkly, but as for the fountain of them, they could not so much as suspect it, and yet it is the very seat of the natural and unclean spot and filth.) lust, except the Law had said, (Exod. 20:17; Deut. 5:21) Thou shalt not lust."},{"number":8,"verse":"But sin took an occasion by the commandment, and wrought in me all manner of concupiscence: for without the Law sin is (Though sin be in us, yet it is not known for sin, neither doth it so rage, as it rageth after that the law is known.) dead."},{"number":9,"verse":"(He setteth himself before us for an example, in whom all men may behold, first what they are of nature before they earnestly think upon the law of God: to wit, blockish, and ready to sin and wickedness, without all true sense and feeling of sin, then what manner of persons they become, when their conscience is reproved by the testimony of the law, to wit, stubborn, and more inflamed with the desire of sin, than ever they were before.) For I once was alive, without the (When I knew not the law, then me thought I lived in deed: for my conscience never troubled me, because it knew not my disease.) law: but when the commandment (When I began to understand the commandment.) came, sin revived,"},{"number":10,"verse":"But I (In sin, or by sin.) died: and the same commandment which was ordained unto life, was found to be unto me unto death."},{"number":11,"verse":"For sin took occasion by the commandment, and deceived me, and thereby slew me."},{"number":12,"verse":"(The conclusion: That the law of itself is holy, but all the fault is in us which abuse the law.) Wherefore the Law is (1 Tim. 1:8) holy, and that (Touching not coveting.) commandment is holy, and just, and good."},{"number":13,"verse":"(The proposition: That the Law is not the cause of death, but our corrupt nature, being therewith not only discovered, but also stirred up, and took occasion thereby to rebel, as which, the more that things are forbidden it, the more it desireth them, and from hence cometh guiltiness, and occasion of death.) Was that then which is good, (Beareth it the blame of my death?) made death unto me? God forbid: but sin, that it might (That sin might show itself to be sin, and bewray itself to be that, which is in deed.) appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good, that sin might be (As evil as it could, showing all the venom it could.) out of measure sinful by the commandment."},{"number":14,"verse":"(The cause of this matter, is this: Because that the Law requireth a heavenly pureness, but men, such as they be born, are bondslaves of corruption, which they willingly serve.)

For since that the Law in a man not regenerate bringeth forth death only, therefore in him it may easily be accused: but seeing that in a man which is regenerate, it bringeth forth good fruit, it doth better appear that evil actions proceed not from the Law, but from sin, that is, from our corrupt nature: And therefore the Apostle teacheth also, what the true use of the Law is, in reproving sin in the regenerate, unto the end of the chapter, as a little before (to wit, from the seventh verse unto this fifteenth) he declared the use of it in them which are not regenerate.) For I (The deeds of my life, saith he, answer not, nay they are contrary to my will: Therefore by the consent of my will with the Law, and repugnancy with the deeds of my life, it appeareth evidently, that the Law and a right ruled do persuade one thing, but corruption which hath her seat also in the regenerate, another thing.) allow not that which I do: for what I (It is to be noted, that one selfsame man is said to will and not to will, in divers respects: to wit, he is said to will, in that, that he is regenerate by grace: and not to will, in that, that he is not regenerate, or in that, that he is such an one as he was born. But because the part which is regenerate, at length becometh conqueror, therefore Paul sustaining the part of the regenerate, speaketh in such sort as if the corruption which sinneth willingly, were something without a man: although afterward he granteth that this evil is in his flesh, or in his members.) would, that do I not: but what I hate, that do I."},{"number":16,"verse":"If I do then that which I would not, I consent to the Law, that it is good."},{"number":17,"verse":"Now then, it is no more I, that do it, but (That natural corruption, which cleaveth fast even to them that are regenerate, and not clean conquered.) sin that dwelleth in me."},{"number":18,"verse":"(This vice, or sin, or law of sin, doth wholly possess those men which are not regenerate, and hindereth them or holdeth them back that are regenerate.)

Therefore to be short, wickedness and death are not of the Law, but of sin, which reigneth in them that are not regenerate: for they neither will, nor do good, but will, and do evil: But in them that are regenerate, it striveth against the Spirit or law of the mind, so that they cannot either live so well as they would, or be so void of sin as they would.)
