What (He passeth now to another benefit of Christ, which is called sanctification or regeneration.) shall we say then? Shall we continue still in (In that corruption: for though the guiltiness of sin be not imputed to us, yet the corruption remaineth still in us: the which Sanctification that followeth Justification killeth by little and little.) sin, that grace may abound? God forbid."},{"number":2,"verse":"(The benefits of Justification and Sanctification, are always joined together inseparably, and both of them proceed from Christ, by the grace of God: Now sanctification is the abolishing of sin, that is, of our natural corruption, into whose place succeedeth the cleanness and pureness of nature reformed.) How shall we, that are (They are said of Paul to be dead to sin, which are in such sort made partakers of the virtue of Christ, that that natural corruption is dead in them, that is, the force of it is put out, and it bringeth not forth his bitter fruits: and on the other side, they are said to live to sin, which are in the flesh, that is, whom the spirit of God hath not delivered from the slavery of the corruption of nature.) dead to sin, live yet therein?"},{"number":3,"verse":"(There are three parts of this Sanctification, to wit, the dead of the old man or sin, his burial, and the resurrection of the new man, descending into us from the virtue of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, of which benefit our baptism is the sign and pledge.) Know ye not, that (Cross references: : Gal. 3:27) all we which have been baptized into (To the end that growing up in one with him, we should receive his strength to quench sin in us, and to make us new men.) Jesus Christ, have been baptized into his death?"},{"number":4,"verse":"(Col. 2:12) We are buried then with him by baptism into his death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead (That Christ himself being discharged of his infirmity and weakness, might live in glory with God forever.) to the glory of the Father, so (And we which are his members rise for this end, that being made partakers of the selfsame virtue, we should begin to lead a new life, as though we were already in heaven.) we also should (Eph. 4:23; Col. 3:3; Heb. 12:1; 1 Pet. 2:1) walk in newness of life."},{"number":5,"verse":"(1 Cor. 6:14; 2 Tim. 2:11) (The death of sin and the life of righteousness, or our ingrafting into Christ, and growing up into one with him, cannot be separated by any means, neither in death nor life, whereby it followeth, that no man is sanctified, which lived still to sin, and therefore is no man made partaker of Christ by faith, which repenteth not, and turneth not from his wickedness: for as he said before, the Law is not subverted, but established by faith.) For if we be planted with him to the (Insomuch as by the means of the strength which cometh from him to us, we so die to sin as he is dead.) similitude of his death, even so shall we (For we become every day more perfect than others: for we shall never be perfectly sanctified, as long as we live here.) be to the similitude of his resurrection,"},{"number":6,"verse":"Knowing this, that our (All our whole nature, as we are conceived and born into this world with sin, which is called old, partly by comparing that old Adam with Christ, and partly also in respect of the deformation of our corrupt nature, which we change with a new.) old man is crucified with (Our corrupt nature is attributed to Christ, not in deed, but by imputation.) him, that the body of (That naughtiness which sticketh fast in us.) sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not (The end of sanctification which we shoot at, and shall at length come to, to wit when God shall be all in all.) serve sin,"},{"number":7,"verse":"(He proveth it by the effects of death, using a comparison of Christ the head with his members.)
