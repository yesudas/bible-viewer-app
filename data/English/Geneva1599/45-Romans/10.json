For they, (The ignorance of the Law which we ought to know, excuseth none before God, especially it excuseth not them that are of his household.) being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and going about to (Ignorance hath always pride joined with it.) establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God."},{"number":4,"verse":"(Cross references: : Gal. 3:24) (The proof: The Law itself hath respect unto Christ, that such as believe in him should be saved. Therefore the calling to salvation by the works of the law is vain and foolish, but Christ is offered for salvation to every believer.) For Christ is the (The end of the Law is to justify them that keep the Law: but seeing we do not observe the Law through the fault of our flesh, we attain not unto this end: but Christ salveth this disease, for he fulfilled the Law for us.) end of the Law for righteousness unto (Not only to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles.) everyone that believeth."},{"number":5,"verse":"(That the Law regardeth and tendeth to Christ, that is a manifest proof, for that is propoundeth such a condition, as can be and is fulfilled of none but Christ only: which being imputed unto us by faith, our conscience is quieted, so that now no man can ask, Who can ascend up into heaven, or bring us from hell, seeing the Gospel teacheth that both of these is done by Christ, and that for their sakes, which with true faith embrace him which calleth them.) For Moses thus describeth the righteousness which is of the Law, (Lev. 18:5; Ezek. 20:11; Gal. 3:12) That the man which doeth these things, shall live thereby."},{"number":6,"verse":"But the righteousness which is of faith, speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is to bring Christ from above.) (Think not with thyself, as men that are staggering use to do.) (Deut. 30:12)"},{"number":7,"verse":"Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is to bring Christ again from the dead.)"},{"number":8,"verse":"(Vocation cometh by the word preached.) But what saith it? (Deut. 30:14) The (By the word, Moses understood the Law which the Lord published with his own voice: and Paul applied it to the preaching of the Gospel which was the perfection of the Law.) word is near thee, even in thy mouth, and in thine heart. This is the word of faith which we preach."},{"number":9,"verse":"(That is indeed true faith which is settled not only in the head, but also in the heart of man, whereof also we give testimony, by our outward life, and which tendeth to Christ as to our alone and only Savior, even as he setteth forth himself in his word.) For if thou shalt (If thou profess plainly, sincerely, and openly, that thou takest Jesus only to be thy Lord and Savior.) confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that (The Father, who is said to have raised the Son from the dead: and this is not spoken to shut out the divinity of the Son, but to set forth the Father’s counsel touching our redemption in the resurrection of the Son.) God raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved:"},{"number":10,"verse":"For with the heart man (Faith is said to justify, and furthermore seeing the confession of the mouth is an effect of faith, and confession is the way to come to salvation, it followeth that faith is also said to save.) believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth man confesseth to salvation."},{"number":11,"verse":"(Now he proveth the other part which he propounded afore in the fourth verse, to wit, that Christ calleth whomsoever he listeth without any difference, and this he confirmeth by a double testimony.) For the Scripture saith, (Isa. 28:16) Whosoever (To believe in God is to yield and consent to God’s promise of our salvation by Christ, and that not only in general, but when we know that the promises pertain to us whereupon riseth a sure trust.) believeth in him, shall not be ashamed."},{"number":12,"verse":"For there is no difference between the Jew and the Grecian: for he that is Lord over all, is rich unto all that call on him."},{"number":13,"verse":"(Joel 2:32) (True calling upon the Name of God is the testimony of true faith, and true faith of true vocation or calling, and true calling, of true election.) For whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord, shall be saved."},{"number":14,"verse":"But how shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? (That is, true faith which seeketh God in his word, and that preached according as God hath appointed in the Church.) and how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?"},{"number":15,"verse":"And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, (Isa. 52:7; Nah. 1:15) How beautiful are the feet of them which bring glad tidings of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!"},{"number":16,"verse":"(Wheresover faith is, there is also the word, but not contrariwise, wheresoever the word is, there is faith also: for many refuse and reject the word.) But they have not (He speaketh this because of the Jews.) all obeyed the Gospel: for Isaiah saith, (Isa. 53:1; John 12:38) Lord, who hath believed our report?"},{"number":17,"verse":"(A conclusion of the former gradation: we must ascend from faith, to our vocation, as by our vocation we came to the testimony of our election.) Then faith is by hearing, and hearing by the (By God’s Commandment.) word of God."},{"number":18,"verse":"(An objection: If calling be a testimony of election, were not the Jews called? why should I not … that, saith the Apostle, seeing that there is no nation which hath not been called? much less can I say, that the Jews were not called.) But I demand, Have they not heard? (Ps. 19:3) No doubt their sound went out through all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world."},{"number":19,"verse":"(The defender and maintainer of the Jews’ cause goeth on still to ask, whether the Jews also knew not God which called them. Isaiah (saith the Apostle) denieth it: and witnesseth that the Gospel was translated from them to the Gentiles, because the Jews neglected it. And therewithall the Apostle teacheth, that that outward and universal calling, which is set forth by the creation of the world, sufficeth not to the knowledge of God: yea, and that the particular also which is by the word of God, is of itself of small or no efficacy, unless it be apprehended or laid hold on by faith, by the gift of God: otherwise by unbelief it is made unprofitable, and that by the only fault of man, who can pretend no ignorance.) But I demand, Did not Israel know God? First Moses saith, (Deut. 32:21) I will provoke you to envy by a (He calleth all profane people, a nation that is no nation, that they are not said to live but to die, which are appointed for everlasting condemnation.) nation that is not my nation, and by a foolish nation I will anger you."},{"number":20,"verse":"(Isa. 65:1) And Isaiah is (Speaketh without fear.) bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not, and have been made manifest to them that asked not after me."},{"number":21,"verse":"And unto Israel he saith, All the day long have I stretched forth mine hand unto a disobedient, and gainsaying people."}]}
