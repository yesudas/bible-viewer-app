I Beseech (The fourth part of this Epistle, which after the finishing of the chief points of Christian doctrine, consisteth in declaring of precepts of Christian life. And first of all he giveth general precepts and grounds: the chiefest whereof is this that every man consecrate himself wholly to the spiritual service of God, and do as it were sacrifice himself, trusting to the grace of God.) you therefore brethren, (By this preface he showeth that God’s glory is the utmost end of all our doings.) by the mercies of God, that ye (In times past the sacrifices were presented before the altar, but now the altar is everywhere.) give up your (Yourselves: in times past, other bodies than our own, now our own must be offered.) bodies a (In times past, dead sacrifices were offered, but now we must offer such as have the spirit of life in them.) living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your (Spiritual.) reasonable serving of God."},{"number":2,"verse":"(The second precept is this, That we take not other men’s opinions or manners for a rule of life, but that we wholly renouncing this world, set before us as our mark, the will of God, as it is manifested and opened unto us in his word.) And fashion not yourselves like unto this world, but be ye changed by the renewing of your (Why then there is no place left for reason, which the heathen Philosophers place as a Queen in a Castle, nor for man’s free will, which the Popish Schoolmen dream on, if the mind must be renewed.

For I (I charge.) say through the grace that is given unto me, to everyone that is among you, that no man (That he please not himself too much, as they do, which persuade themselves they know more than indeed they do.) presume to understand above that which is meet to understand, but that he understand according to (We will be sober if we take not that upon us, which we have not, and if we brag not of that we have.) sobriety, as God hath dealt to every man the (1 Cor. 12:11; Eph. 4:7) measure of (By faith he meaneth the knowledge of God in Christ, and the gifts which the holy Ghost poureth upon the faithful.) faith."},{"number":4,"verse":"(There is a double reason of the precept going afore: the one is because God hath not committed everything to be done of every man: and therefore, he doeth backwardly, and not only unprofitably, but also to the great disprofit of others, wearieth himself and others, which passeth the bounds of his vocation: the other is, for that this diversity and inequality of vocations and gifts, redoundeth to our commodity seeing that the same is therefore instituted and appointed, that we should be bound one to another. Whereupon it followeth that no man ought to be grieved thereat, seeing that the use of every private gift is common.)
