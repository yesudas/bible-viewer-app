I Demand then, (Now the Apostle showeth how this doctrine is to be applied to others, abiding still in his propounded cause. Therefore he teacheth us that all the Jews in particular are not cast away, and therefore we ought not to pronounce rashly of private persons, whether they be of the number of the elect or not.) Hath God cast away his people? God forbid: for (The first proof, I am a Jew, and yet elected, therefore we may and ought fully to resolve upon our election, as hath been before said: but of another man’s we cannot be so certainly resolved, and yet ours may cause us to hope well of others.) I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."},{"number":2,"verse":"(The second proof: Because that God is faithful in his league or Covenant, although men be unfaithful: So then seeing that God hath said, that he will be the God of his unto a thousand generations, we must take heed, that we think not that the whole race and offspring is cast off, by reason of the unbelief of a few, but rather, that we hope well of every member of the Church, because of God’s league and Covenant.) God hath not cast away his people which he (Which he loved and chose from everlasting.) knew before. (The third proof, taken from the answer that was made to Elijah: even then also, when there appeared openly to the face of the world no elect, yet God knew his elect and chosen, and of them also good store and number. Whereupon this also is concluded, that we ought not rashly to pronounce of any man as of a reprobate, seeing that the Church is oftentimes brought to that state, that even the most watchful and sharp-sighted pastors think it to be clean extinct and put out.) Know ye not what the Scripture saith of Elijah, how he communeth with God against Israel, saying,"},{"number":3,"verse":"(Cross references: : 1 Kings 19:10) Lord, they have killed thy Prophets, and dug down thine Altars: and I am left alone, and they seek my life?"},{"number":4,"verse":"But what saith the answer of God to him? (1 Kings 19:18) I have (He speaketh of remnants and reserved people which were chosen from everlasting, and not of remnants that should be chosen afterward: for they are not chosen, because they were not idolaters, but therefore they were not idolaters, because they were chosen and elect.) reserved unto myself seven thousand men, which have not bowed the knee to (Baal signifieth as much as Master or patron, or one in whose power another is, which name the idolaters at this day give their idols, naming them patrons, and patronesses or Ladies.) Baal."},{"number":5,"verse":"Even so then, at this present time is there a remnant according to the (The election of grace, is not whereby men chose grace, but whereby God chose us of his grace and goodness.) election of grace."},{"number":6,"verse":"(Although that all be not elect and chosen, yet let them that are elected, remember that they are freely chosen, and let them that stubbornly refuse the grace and free mercy of God, impute it unto themselves.) And if it be of grace, it is (This saying beateth down flat to the ground all the doctrine of all kinds and manner of works, whereby our justifiers of themselves do teach, that works are either wholly or partly the cause of our justification.) no more of works: or else were grace no more grace: but if it be of works, it is no more grace: or else were work no more work."},{"number":7,"verse":"What then? Israel hath not obtained that he sought: but the election hath obtained it, and the rest have been (See Mark 3:5.) hardened,"},{"number":8,"verse":"(And yet this hardness of heart cometh not but by God’s just decree and judgment, and yet without fault, whom as he so punisheth the unthankful by taking from them all sense and perseverance and by doubling their darkness, that the benefits of God which are offered unto them, do redound to their just destruction.) According as it is written, (Isa. 6:9; Isa. 29:10; Matt. 13:14; John 12:40; Acts 28:26) God hath given them the spirit of (A very dead sleep which taketh away all sense.) slumber: eyes that they (That is, eyes unjust to see.) should not see, and ears that they should not hear unto this day."},{"number":9,"verse":"And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a net, and a stumbling block, even for a recompense unto them. (As unhappy birds are enticed to death by that which is their sustenance, so did that only thing turn to the Jews’ destruction, out of which they sought life, to wit, the Law of God, for the preposterous zeal whereof they refused the Gospel.)

And hereby we may learn, that the severity of God serveth as well for the setting forth of his glory as his mercy doth, and also that God prepares himself a way to mercy, by his severity, so that we ought not rashly to despair of any man, nor proudly triumph over other men, but rather provoke them to an holy emulation, that God may be glorified in them also.) I demand then, Have they stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid: but through their fall, salvation cometh unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to follow them."},{"number":12,"verse":"Wherefore if the fall of them be the (By riches he meaneth the knowledge of the Gospel to everlasting life: and by the world, all nations dispersed throughout the whole world.) riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more shall their (Of the Jews, when the whole nation without exception shall come to Christ.) abundance be?"},{"number":13,"verse":"(He witnesseth by his own example, that he goeth before all others in this behalf.) For in that I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I (I make noble and famous.) magnify mine office,"},{"number":14,"verse":"To try if by any means I might provoke them of my flesh to follow them, and might save some of them."},{"number":15,"verse":"For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving be, (It shall come to pass that when the Jews come to the Gospel, the world shall as it were come quicken again, and rise up from death to life.) but life from the dead?"},{"number":16,"verse":"(The nation of the Jews being considered in their stock and root, that is, in Abraham, is holy, although that many of the branches be cut off. Therefore in judging of our brethren, we must not stick in their unworthiness, to think that they are at once all cast off, but we ought to consider the root of the Covenant, and rather go back to their ancestors which were faithful, that we may know that the blessing of the Covenant resteth in some of their posterity, as we also find proof hereof in ourselves.) For if the (He alludeth to the firstfruits of the loaves by the offering whereof all the whole crop of corn was sanctified, and they might vie the rest of the year following with good conscience.) firstfruits be holy, so is the whole lump: and if the (Abraham.) root be holy, so are the branches."},{"number":17,"verse":"(Jer. 11:6) (There is no cause why the Gentiles which have obtained mercy, should triumph over the Jews which condemn the grace of God, seeing they are grafted into the Jews’ ancestors. But let them rather take heed that that also be not found in them which is worthily condemned in the Jews. And hereof also this general doctrine may be gathered and taken, that we ought to be studious of God’s glory, even in respect of our neighbors: so far ought we to be from bragging and glorying, for that, that we are preferred before others by a singular grace.) And though some of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild Olive tree, wast grafted in (In place of those boughs which are broken off.) for them, and made (It is against the common course of husbandry, that the barren juice of the imp is changed with the juice of the good tree.) partaker of the root and fatness of the Olive tree:"},{"number":18,"verse":"(We may rejoice in the Lord, but so that we despise not the Jews, whom we ought rather to provoke to that good striving with us.)

Behold therefore the (The tender and loving heart.) bountifulness, and severity of God: toward them which have fallen, severity: but toward thee, bountifulness, if thou continue in his (In that state which God’s bountifulness hath advanced thee unto: and we must mark here, that he speaketh not of the election of every private man, which remaineth steadfast forever, but of the election of the whole nation.) bountifulness: or else thou shalt also be cut off."},{"number":23,"verse":"(Many are now for a season cut off, that is, are without the root, which in their time shall be grafted in: and again there are a great sort, which after a sort, and touching the outward show, seem to be ingrafted, which notwithstanding through their own fault afterward are cut off and clean cast away: which thing is especially to be considered in nations and peoples, as in the Gentiles and Jews.)
