And he taketh the example of circumcision, because it was the ground of all the service of the Law, and was chiefly urged of the false Apostles.) Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be (Circumcision is in other places called the seal of righteousness, but here we must have consideration of the circumstance of the Baptism come in place of circumcision. And moreover Paul reasoneth according to the opinion that his enemies had of it, which made circumcision a piece of their salvation.) circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."},{"number":3,"verse":"For I testify again to every man, which is circumcised, that he is bound to keep the whole Law."},{"number":4,"verse":"Ye are abolished from Christ: whosoever are (That is, seek to be justified by the Law, for in deed no man is justified by the Law.) justified by the Law, ye are fallen from grace. (That is, as he himself expoundeth it afterwards, ye are fallen from grace.) (1 Cor. 1:17)"},{"number":5,"verse":"(He privily compareth the new people with the old: for it is certain that they also did ground all their hope of justification and life in faith and not in circumcision, but so, that their faith was wrapped in the external and ceremonial worship: but our faith is bare and content with spiritual worship.) For we through the (Through the Spirit, which engendereth faith.) Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness through faith."},{"number":6,"verse":"(He addeth a reason for that now circumcision is abolished, seeing that Christ is exhibited unto us with full plenty of spiritual circumcision.) For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, neither (He maketh mention also of uncircumcision, lest the Gentiles should please themselves in it, as the Jews do in circumcision.) uncircumcision, (The taking away of an objection: If all that worship of the Law be taken away, wherein then shall we exercise ourselves? In charity, saith Paul: for faith, whereof we speak, cannot be idle, nay it bringeth forth daily fruits of charity.) but (So is true faith distinguished from counterfeit faith: for charity is not joined to faith as a fellow cause, to help forward our justification with faith.) faith which worketh by love."},{"number":7,"verse":"(Again he chideth the Galatians, but with an admiration, and therewithall a praise of their former race, to the end that he may make them more ashamed.) Ye did run well: who did let you, that ye did not obey the truth?"},{"number":8,"verse":"(He playeth the part of an Apostle with them, and useth his authority, denying that that doctrine can come from God which is contrary to his.) It is not the persuasion of (Of God.) him that calleth you."},{"number":9,"verse":"(1 Cor. 5:6) (He addeth this, that he may not seem to contend upon a trifle, warning them diligently (by a similitude which he borroweth of leaven, as Christ himself also did) not to suffer the purity of the Apostolical doctrine, to be infected with the least corruption that may be.) A little leaven doth leaven the whole lump."},{"number":10,"verse":"(He mitigateth the former reprehension, casting the fault upon the false Apostles, against whom he denounceth the horrible judgment of God.) I have trust in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you, shall bear his condemnation, whosoever he be."},{"number":11,"verse":"(He willeth them to consider how that he seeketh not his own profit in this matter, seeing that he could eschew the hatred of men, if he would join Judaism with Christianity.) And brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the slander of the cross abolished."},{"number":12,"verse":"(An example of a true Pastor inflamed with the zeal of God’s glory and love of his flock.) Would to God they were even cut off which do (For they that preach the Law, cause men’s consciences always to tremble.) disquiet you."},{"number":13,"verse":"For brethren, ye have been called unto liberty: (The third part of this Epistle, showing that the right use of Christian liberty consisteth in this, that being delivered from the slavery of sin and the flesh, and being obedient to the Spirit, we should serve unto one another’s salvation through love.) only use not your liberty as an occasion unto the flesh, but by love serve one another."},{"number":14,"verse":"(He propoundeth the love of our neighbor, as a mark whereunto all Christians ought to refer all their actions, and thereunto he citeth the testimony of the Law.) For (This particle (All) must be restrained to the second table.) all the Law is fulfilled in one word, which is this, (Lev. 19:18; Matt. 22:39; Mark 12:31; Rom. 13:9; James 2:8) Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."},{"number":15,"verse":"(An exhortation to the duties of charity, by the profit that ensueth thereof, because that no men provide worse for themselves, than they that hate one another.) If ye bite and devour one another, take heed lest ye be consumed one of another."},{"number":16,"verse":"(He acknowledgeth the great weakness of the godly, for that they are but in part regenerate: but he willeth them to remember that they are endued with the Spirit of God, which hath delivered them from the slavery of sin, and so of the Law so far forth as it is the virtue of sin, that they should not give themselves to lusts.)
