Then (He declareth that by another double similitude, which he said before concerning the keeper and schoolmaster. For he saith, that the Law, (that is, the whole government of God’s house according to the Law) was as it were a tutor or overseer appointed for a time, until such time as that protection and overseeing which was but for a time, being ended, we should at length come to be at our own liberty, and should live as children, and not as servants. Moreover, he showeth by the way, that that governance of the Law, was as it were an ABC, and as certain principles in comparison of the doctrine of the Gospel.) I say, that the heir as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be Lord of all,"},{"number":2,"verse":"But is under tutors and governors, (This is added, because he that is always under a tutor or governor, may hardly be counted a freeman.) until the time appointed of the Father."},{"number":3,"verse":"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the (The Law is called rudiments, because that by the Law God instructed his Church as it were by rudiments, and afterward poured out his holy Spirit most plentifully in the time of the Gospel.) rudiments of the world."},{"number":4,"verse":"(He uttereth and declareth many things at once, to wit, that this tutorship was ended at his time, that curious men may leave to ask, why that schoolmastership lasted so long. And moreover, that we are not sons by nature, but by adoption, and that in that Son of God, who therefore took upon him our flesh, that we might be made his brethren.) But when the (The time is said to be full, when all parts of it are past and ended, and therefore Christ could not have come either sooner or later.) fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a (He calleth Mary a woman, in respect of the sex, and not as the word is used in a contrary sense to a virgin still.) woman, and made under the Law,"},{"number":5,"verse":"That he might redeem them which were under the Law, that we (Cross references: : Rom. 8:15) might receive the (The adoption of the sons of God, is from everlasting, but is revealed and showed in the time appointed for it.) adoption of the sons."},{"number":6,"verse":"(He showeth that we are in such sort free and set at liberty, that in the mean season we must be governed by the Spirit of Christ, which reigning in our hearts, may teach us the true service of the Father. But this is not to serve, but rather to enjoy true liberality, as it cometh sons and heirs.) And because ye are sons, God hath (By that that followeth he gathereth that that went before: for if we have his spirit, we are his sons, and if we are his sons, then are we free.) sent forth the (The holy Ghost, who is both of the Father and of the Son: but there is a peculiar reason why he is called the Spirit of the Son, to wit, because the holy Ghost sealeth up our adoption in Christ, and maketh us a full assurance of it.)

But even then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them, which by nature are not gods:"},{"number":9,"verse":"But now seeing ye know God, yea, rather are known of God, how turn ye again unto impotent and (They are called impotent and beggarly ceremonies, being considered apart by themselves without Christ: and again, for that by that means they gave good testimony that they were beggars in Christ, when as notwithstanding, for men, to fall back from Christ to ceremonies, is nothing else, but to cast away riches, and to follow beggarly.) beggarly rudiments, whereunto as from the beginning ye will be in bondage (By going backward.) again?"},{"number":10,"verse":"Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years."},{"number":11,"verse":"I am in fear of you, lest I have bestowed on you labor in vain."},{"number":12,"verse":"(He mitigateth and qualifieth those things wherein he might have seemed to have spoken somewhat sharply, very artificially and divinely, declaring his good will towards them in such sort, that the Galatians could not but either be utterly desperate when they read these things, or acknowledge their own lightness with tears, and desire pardon.) Be ye as I (for I am even as you) brethren, I beseech you: ye have not hurt me at all."},{"number":13,"verse":"And ye know, how through (Many afflictions.) infirmity of the flesh, I preached the Gospel unto you at the first."},{"number":14,"verse":"And the (Those daily troubles wherewith the Lord tried me amongst you.) trial of me which was in my flesh, ye despised not, neither abhorred: but ye received me as an Angel of God, yea, as (For my ministry’s sake.)

The one was made in Sinai, without the land of promise according to which covenant Abraham’s children according to the flesh were begotten: to wit, the Jews which seek righteousness by that covenant, that is, by the Law: but they are not heirs, nay they shall at length be cast out of the house, as they that persecute the true heirs. The other was made in that high Jerusalem or in Zion (to wit, by the sacrifice of Christ) which begetteth children of promise, to wit, believers by the virtue of the holy Ghost which children (as Abraham) do rest themselves in the free promise, and they only by the right of children shall be partakers of the father’s inheritance, and those servants shall be shut out.)
