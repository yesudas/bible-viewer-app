And so this place also concerning the glory to come, is put within the treatise of the dignity of the ministry, as the other was, whereof we spake in the beginning of the second Chapter.) we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be destroyed, we have a building given of God, that is, an house not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens."},{"number":2,"verse":"For therefore we sigh, desiring to be (He calleth the glory of immortality, which we shall be as it were clothed with, a garment.) clothed with our house, which is from (Heavenly, not that the substance of it is heavenly, but for the glory of it.) heaven."},{"number":3,"verse":"(An exposition of the former saying: We do not without cause, desire to be clad with the heavenly house, that is, with that everlasting and immortal glory, as with a garment: for when we depart hence, we shall not remain naked, having once cast off the covering of this body, but we shall take our bodies again, which shall put on as it were another garment besides: and therefore we sigh not for the weariness of this life, but for the desire of a better life. Neither is this desire in vain, for we are made to that life, the pledge whereof we have, even the Spirit of adoption.) Because that if we be clothed, we shall not be found (Cross references: : Rev. 16:15) naked."},{"number":4,"verse":"For indeed we that are in this tabernacle, sigh and are burdened because we would not be unclothed, but would be clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."},{"number":5,"verse":"And he that hath (He meaneth that first creation, to give us to understand, that our bodies were made to this end, that they should be clothed with heavenly immortality.) created us for this thing, is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit."},{"number":6,"verse":"(He inferreth upon that sentence which went next before, thus, Therefore, seeing that we know by the Spirit, that we are strangers so long as we are here, we patiently suffer this tarriance (for we are now so with God, that we behold him but by faith, and are therefore now absent from him) but so that we aspire and have a longing always to him: therefore also we behave ourselves so, that we may be acceptable to him, both while we live here, and when we go from hence to him.) Therefore we are always (He calleth them (bold) which are always resolved with a quiet and settled mind to suffer what dangers soever, nothing doubting, but their end shall be happy.) bold, though we know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord."},{"number":7,"verse":"(For we walk by (Faith of those things which we hope for, and not having God presently in our view.) faith, and not by sight.)"},{"number":8,"verse":"Nevertheless, we are (And yet we are in such sort bold and do so pass on our pilgrimage with a valiant and quiet mind, that yet notwithstanding, we had rather depart hence to the Lord.) bold, and love rather to remove out of the body, and to dwell with the Lord."},{"number":9,"verse":"Wherefore also we (And seeing it is so, we strive to live so, that both in this our pilgrimage here we may please him, and that at length we may be received home to him.) covet, that both dwelling at home, and removing from home, we may be acceptable to him."},{"number":10,"verse":"(Rom. 14:10) (That no man might think it to pertain to all, which he spoke of that heavenly glory, he addeth, that every one shall first render an account of his pilgrimage, after that he is departed from hence.) For we must all (We must all appear personally, and inquiry shall be made of us, that all may see, how we have lived.) appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every man may receive the things which are done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil."},{"number":11,"verse":"(Now he passeth over, and taking occasion of the former sentence, returneth to 4:16, confirming his own sincerity and his fellows’.) Knowing therefore that (That terrible judgment.) terror of the Lord, we persuade men, and we are made manifest unto God, and I trust also that we are made manifest in your consciences."},{"number":12,"verse":"(He removeth all suspicion of pride, by a new reason, because it is behoovable, not for his part, but for theirs, that his Apostleship be counted sincere against the vain ostentation of a few others.) For we praise not ourselves again unto you, but give you an occasion to rejoice of us that ye may have to answer against them, which rejoice in the (In outward disguising, and that colored show of man’s wisdom and eloquence, and not in true godliness, which is sealed in the heart.) face, and not in the heart."},{"number":13,"verse":"(The meaning is: Even when I am mad (as some men think of me) while I seem as a fool to boast myself, I do it for your profit, no less than when I preach the Gospel simply unto you.) For whether we be out of our wit, we are it to God: or whether we be in our right mind, we are it unto you."},{"number":14,"verse":"(He goeth forward in putting away all suspicion of desire of estimation and boasting: for the love of Christ, saith he, compelleth us hereunto, that seeing he died for us all, which were dead when as we lived to ourselves (that is, while we were yet given to these earthly affections) we in like sort should consecrate our whole life which we have received of him, to him (to wit) being endued with the holy Ghost to this end and purpose, that we should meditate upon nothing but that which is heavenly.) For that love of Christ (Possesseth us wholly.) constraineth us,"},{"number":15,"verse":"Because we thus judge, that if (He speaketh here of sanctification, whereby it cometh to pass that Christ liveth in us.) one be dead for all, then were all dead, and he died for all, that they which live, should not henceforth (See Romans, chapters 6 and 7.) live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again."},{"number":16,"verse":"(He showeth what it is, not to live to ourselves, but to Christ, to wit, to know no man according to the flesh, that is to say, to be so conversant amongst men, as not to care for those worldly and carnal things, as they do which respect a man’s stock, his country, form, glory, riches, and such like, wherein men commonly dote, and weary themselves.) Wherefore, henceforth know we no man after the flesh, (An amplification: This is, saith he, so true, that we do not now think carnally of Christ himself, who hath now left the world, and therefore must be considered of us spiritually.) yea though we had known Christ after the flesh, yet not henceforth know we him no more."},{"number":17,"verse":"(An exhortation for every man which is renewed with the spirit of Christ, to meditate heavenly things, and not earthly.) Therefore if any man be in Christ, let him be a (As a thing made anew of God, for though a man be not newly created when God giveth him the spirit of regeneration, but only his qualities are changed, yet notwithstanding it pleased the holy Ghost to speak so, to teach us, that we must attribute all things to the glory of God: not that we are as stocks or blocks: but because God creates in us, both the will to will well, and the power to do well.) new creature. (Isa. 43:19; Rev. 21:5) Old things are passed away: behold, all things are become new."},{"number":18,"verse":"(He commendeth the excellency of the ministry of the Gospel, both by the authority of God himself, who is the author of that ministry, and also by the excellency of the doctrine of it: for it announceth atonement with God, by free forgiveness of our sins, and justification offered unto us in Christ, and that so lovingly and liberally, that God himself doth after a sort pray men by the mouth of his ministers, to have consideration of themselves, and not to despise so great a benefit. And when he so saith, he plainly reprehendeth them which falsely challenged to themselves the name of pastors.) And all things are of God, which hath reconciled us unto himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given unto us the ministry of reconciliation."},{"number":19,"verse":"For God was in Christ, and reconciled the world to himself, not imputing their sins unto them, and hath (Used our labor and travail.) committed to us the word of reconciliation."},{"number":20,"verse":"Now then are we ambassadors for Christ: as though God did beseech you through us, we pray you in Christ’s stead, that ye be reconciled to God."},{"number":21,"verse":"For he hath made him to be (A sinner, not in himself, but by imputation of the guilt of all our sins to him.) sin for us, which (Who was clean void of sin.) knew no sin, that we should be made the (Righteous before God, and that with righteousness which is not essential to us, but being essential in Christ, God imputeth it to us through faith.) righteousness of God in him."}]}
