Lo this is the third time that I come unto you. (Cross references: : Deut. 19:17; Matt. 18:16; John 8:17; Heb. 10:28) In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand."},{"number":2,"verse":"I told you before, and tell you before: as though I had been present the second time, so write I now being absent to them, which heretofore have sinned, and to all others, that if I come again, I will not spare,"},{"number":3,"verse":"(A most sharp reprehension, for that, while they despise the Apostle’s admonitions, they tempt Christ’s own patience: and also while they condemn him as wretched and miserable, they lay nothing herein against him, which is not common to him with Christ.) Seeing that ye seek experience of Christ, that speaketh in me, which toward you is not weak, but is (And will be most mighty to be revenged of you, when need shall be.) mighty in you."},{"number":4,"verse":"For though he was crucified concerning (As touching that base form of a servant which he took upon him when he abased himself.) his infirmity, yet liveth he through the power of God. And we no doubt are weak in him, but we shall live with him, through the power of God toward you."},{"number":5,"verse":"(1 Cor. 11:28) (He confirmeth that which he spake of the virtue of God appearing in his ministry, and he gathereth by the mutual relation between the people’s faith and the minister’s preaching, that they must either reverence his Apostleship, upon whose doctrine their faith is grounded, or they must condemn themselves of infidelity, and must confess themselves not to be of Christ’s body.) Prove yourselves whether ye are in the faith: examine yourselves: know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?"},{"number":6,"verse":"(He mitigateth that sharpness, trusting that they will show themselves towards their faithful Apostle, apt and willingly to be taught: adding this moreover, that he passeth not for his own fame and estimation, so that he may serve to their salvation, which is the only mark that he shooteth at.) But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates."},{"number":7,"verse":"Now I pray unto God that ye do none evil, not that we should seem approved, but that ye should do that which is honest: though we be as (In men’s judgment.) reprobates."},{"number":8,"verse":"For we cannot do anything against the truth, but for the truth."},{"number":9,"verse":"For we are glad when we are weak, and that ye are strong: this also we wish for, even your (That all things may be in good order amongst you, and the members of the Church restored into their place, which have been shaken and out of place.) perfection."},{"number":10,"verse":"Therefore write I these things being absent, lest when I am present, I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me, to edification, and not to destruction."},{"number":11,"verse":"(A brief exhortation, but yet such an one as comprehendeth all the parts of a Christian man’s life.)
