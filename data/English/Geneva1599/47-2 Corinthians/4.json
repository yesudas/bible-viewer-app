He answereth, The fault is in the men themselves, whose eyes Satan plucketh out, who ruleth in this world. And yet notwithstanding doth he and his fellows set forth the most clear light of the Gospel to be seen and beholden, seeing that Christ whom only they preach, is he in whom only God will be known, and as it were seen.) If the Gospel be then hid, it is hid to them that are lost."},{"number":4,"verse":"In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds, that is, of the infidels, that the (The light of plain and lightsome preaching, which telleth forth the glory of Christ.) light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the (In whom the Father setteth forth himself to be seen and beholden.) image of God, should not shine unto them."},{"number":5,"verse":"(He removeth according to his accustomed manner, all suspicion of ambition: avouching that he teacheth faithfully, but as a servant, and witnessing that all this light which he and his fellows give to others, proceedeth from the Lord.) For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for (To preach this selfsame Jesus to you.) Jesus’ sake."},{"number":6,"verse":"For God that commanded the light to shine out of darkness, is he which hath shined in our hearts, to give the (That being lightened of God, we should in like sort give that light to others.) light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. (Which made only with his word.) (Cross references: : Gen. 1:3)"},{"number":7,"verse":"(He taketh away a stumbling block, by which was darkened, amongst some, the bright shining of the ministry of the Gospel, to wit, because the Apostles were the most miserable of all men, Paul answereth that he and his fellows are as it were earthen vessels, but yet there is in them a most precious treasure.) But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, (He bringeth marvelous reasons, why the Lord doth so afflict his chiefest servants, to the end saith he that all men may perceive that they stand not by any man’s virtue, but by the singular virtue of God, in that they die a thousand times, but never perish.) that the excellency of that power might be of God, and not of us."},{"number":8,"verse":"We are afflicted on every side, yet are we not in distress: we are in doubt, but yet we despair not."},{"number":9,"verse":"We are persecuted, but not forsaken: cast down, but we perish not."},{"number":10,"verse":"(An amplification of the former sentence, wherein he compareth his afflictions to a daily death, and the virtue of the Spirit of God in Christ, to life, which oppresseth that death.)

So then death worketh in us, and life in you."},{"number":13,"verse":"(He declareth the former sentence, showing that he and his fellows die in a sort to purchase life to others, but yet notwithstanding they are partakers of the same life with them: because they themselves do first believe that, which they propound to others to believe, to wit, that they also shall be saved together with them in Christ.) And because we have the same (The same faith by the inspiration of the same Spirit.) spirit of faith, according as it is written, (Ps. 116:10) I believed, and therefore have I spoken, we also believe, and therefore speak,"},{"number":14,"verse":"Knowing that he which hath raised up the Lord Jesus, shall raise us up also by Jesus, and shall set us with you."},{"number":15,"verse":"(He showeth how this constancy is preserved in them, to wit, because they respect God’s glory, and the salvation of the Churches committed unto them.)
