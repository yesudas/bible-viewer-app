Now (He returneth to the defense of his Apostleship, but so that he useth this authority therein: for he warneth them earnestly and gravely, using also terrible threatenings to show themselves such as are apt to be instructed. And he refelleth certain proud men which made no better accompt of him, than of a bragging Thraso, in that he used to be sharp against them when he was absent, because they saw no great majesty in him after the manner of men, and besides, had proved his lenity, notwithstanding that in his absence, he had written to them sharply. Therefore first of all he professeth that he was gentle and moderate, but after the example of Christ: but if they continue, still to despise his gentleness, he protesteth unto them that he will show indeed how far they are deceived, which make that accompt of the office of an Apostle, that they do of worldly offices, that is, according to the outward appearance.) I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness, and (That nature which is inclined to mercy, rather than to rigor of justice.) gentleness of Christ, which when I am present among you am base, but am bold toward you being absent:"},{"number":2,"verse":"And this I require you, that I need not to be bold when I am present, with that same confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which esteem us as though we walked (As though I had no other aid and help than that which outwardly I seem to have: and therefore Paul setteth his flesh, that is, his weak condition and state, against his spiritual and Apostolic dignity.) according to the flesh."},{"number":3,"verse":"(Secondly he witnesseth, that although he be like unto other men, yet he cometh furnished with that strength, which no holds of man can match, whether they resist by craft and deceit, or by force and might, because he warrioreth with divine weapons.) Nevertheless, though we walk in the flesh, yet we do not war after the flesh."},{"number":4,"verse":"(For the weapons of our warfare are not (Are not such as men get them authority withall one of another, and do great acts.) carnal, but mighty through (Stand upon that infinite power of God.) God, to cast down holds.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"Casting down the imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, (An amplification of this spiritual virtue, which in such sort conquereth the enemies be they never so crafty and mighty, that it bringeth some of them by repentance unto Christ, and justly revengeth others, that are stubbornly obstinate, separating them from the others which suffer themselves to be ruled.) and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ,"},{"number":6,"verse":"And having ready the vengeance against all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled."},{"number":7,"verse":"(He beateth into their heads that same matter, with great weight of words and sentences.) Look ye on things after the (Do ye judge of things according to the outward show.) appearance? If any man trust in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again of (Not being told of it by me.) himself, that as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s."},{"number":8,"verse":"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should have no shame."},{"number":9,"verse":"This I say, that I may not seem as it were to fear you with letters."},{"number":10,"verse":"For the letters, saith (He noteth out someone that was the seeds man of this speech.) he, are sore and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is of no value."},{"number":11,"verse":"Let such one think this, that such as we are in word by letters, when we are absent, such will we be also in deed, when we are present."},{"number":12,"verse":"(Being constrained to refel the foolish brags of certain ambitious men, he witnesseth, that they are able to bring nothing, but that they falsely persuade themselves of themselves: and as for himself, although he brags of excellent things, yet he will not pass the bounds which God hath measured him out, according whereunto he came even unto them in preaching the Gospel of Christ, and trusteth that he shall go further, when they have so profited that he shall not need to tarry any longer amongst them to instruct them. And hereunto is added an amplification, in that he never succeeded other men in their labors.) For we (This is spoken after a taunting sort.) dare not make ourselves of the number, or to compare ourselves to them, which praise themselves: but they understand not that they measure themselves with (Upon a vain persuasion that they have of themselves, they take upon them they care not what.) themselves, and (They condemn all others, and measure all their doings only by themselves.) compare themselves with themselves."},{"number":13,"verse":"But we will not rejoice of things, which are not within our (Of those things which God hath not measured to me.) measure, (Cross references: : Eph. 4:7) but according to the measure of the line, whereof God hath distributed unto us a measure to attain even unto you."},{"number":14,"verse":"For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we had not attained unto you: for even to you also have we come in preaching the Gospel of Christ."},{"number":15,"verse":"Not boasting of things which are (As though God had divided the whole world among the Apostles, to be husbanded.) without our measure: that is, of other men’s labors: and we hope, when your faith shall increase, to be magnified by you according to your line abundantly,"},{"number":16,"verse":"And to preach the Gospel in those regions which are beyond you: not to rejoice in (In countries which other men have prepared and husbanded with the preaching of the Gospel.) another man’s line: that is, in the things that are prepared already."},{"number":17,"verse":"(Jer. 9:24; 1 Cor. 1:31) (He somewhat mitigateth that which he spake of himself and therewith also prepareth the Corinthians to hear other things, witnessing that he seeketh nothing else but to approve himself to God, whose glory he only seeketh.) But let him that rejoiceth, rejoice in the Lord."},{"number":18,"verse":"For he that praiseth himself, is not allowed, but he whom the Lord praiseth."}]}
