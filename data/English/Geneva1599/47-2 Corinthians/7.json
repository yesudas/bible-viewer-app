Seeing then we have these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the (Both of body and soul, that by this means the sanctification may be perfect, consisting in both the parts thereof.) flesh and spirit, and finish our sanctification in the fear of God."},{"number":2,"verse":"Receive us: we have done wrong to no man: we have corrupted no man: we have defrauded no man.
