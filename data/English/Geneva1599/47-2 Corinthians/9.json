Therefore he witnesseth that he doeth it not to teach them that they ought to help the Saints, seeing that he had become surety for them to the Macedonians, but only to stir them up which were running of themselves to the end that all things might both be in a better readiness, and also be more plentiful.) as touching the ministering to the Saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you."},{"number":2,"verse":"For I know your readiness of mind, whereof I boast myself of you unto them of Macedonia, and say, that Achaia was prepared a year ago, and your zeal hath provoked many."},{"number":3,"verse":"Now have I sent the brethren, lest our rejoicing over you should be in vain in this behalf, that ye (as I have said) be ready."},{"number":4,"verse":"Lest if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we may not say, you) should be ashamed in this my (The word which he useth, signifieth such a stayedness and settledness of mind, as cannot be moved with any terror or fear.) constant boasting."},{"number":5,"verse":"Wherefore, I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to come before unto you, and to finish your benevolence appointed afore, that it might be ready, and come as of benevolence, and not as of (As from covetous men.) niggardliness."},{"number":6,"verse":"(Alms must be given neither niggardly, nor with a loathful mind, or hardly: But as frank and free alms is compared to a sowing which hath a most plentiful harvest of most abundant blessing following it.)
