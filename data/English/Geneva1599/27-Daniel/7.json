approached, that the Saints possessed the kingdom."},{"number":23,"verse":"Then he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom in the earth, which shall be unlike to all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down and break it in pieces."},{"number":24,"verse":"And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten Kings that shall rise: and another shall rise after them,
