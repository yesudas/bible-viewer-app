Behold, what love the Father hath given to us, that we should be (That we should be the sons of God, and so that all the world may perceive we are so.) called the sons of God: (Before he declareth this adoption, he saith two things: the one, that this so great a dignity is not to be esteemed, according to the judgment of the flesh, because it is unknown to the world, for the world knoweth not God the Father himself.) For this cause this world knoweth you not, because it knoweth not him."},{"number":2,"verse":"(The other: This dignity is not fully made manifest to ourselves, much less to strangers, but we are sure of the accomplishment of it, insomuch that we shall be like to the Son of God himself, and shall enjoy his sight indeed, such as he is now: but yet notwithstanding this is deferred until his next coming.) Dearly beloved, now are we the sons of God, but yet it is not made manifest what we shall be: and we know that when he shall be made manifest: we shall be (Like, but not equal.) like him: for we shall see him (For now we see as in a glass, 1 Cor. 13:12.) as he is."},{"number":3,"verse":"(Now he describeth this adoption, (the glory whereof as yet consisteth in hope) by the effect, to wit, because that whosoever is made the Son of God, endeavoreth to resemble the Father in purity.) And every man that hath this hope in him purgeth himself, even (This word signifieth a likeness, but not in equality.) as he is pure."},{"number":4,"verse":"(The rule of this purity can from no whence else be taken but from the Law of God, the transgression whereof is that which is called sin.) Whosoever (Giveth not himself to pureness.) commiteth sin, transgresseth also the Law: for (A short definition of sin.) sin is the transgression of the Law."},{"number":5,"verse":"(An argument taken from the material cause of our salvation: Christ in himself is most pure, and he came to take away our sins, by sanctifying us with the holy Ghost. Therefore, whosoever is truly partaker of Christ doth not give himself to sin: and so contrariwise he that giveth himself to sin knoweth not Christ.) And ye know that he was made manifest, that he might (Cross references: : Isa. 53:69; 2 Pet. 2:2224) take away our sins, and in him is no sin."},{"number":6,"verse":"Whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not: whosoever (He is said to sin, that giveth not himself to pureness, and in him sin reigneth, but sin is said to dwell in the faithful, and not to reign in them.) sinneth, hath not seen him, neither hath known him."},{"number":7,"verse":"(Another argument of things coupled together: He that liveth justly, is just, and resembleth Christ that is just, and by that is known to be the son of God.) Little children, let no man deceive you, he that doeth righteousness, is righteous, as he is righteous."},{"number":8,"verse":"(An argument taken of contraries: the devil is the author of sin, and therefore he is of the devil, or is ruled by the inspiration of the devil that serve sin: and if he be the devil’s son, then is he not God’s son: for the devil and God are so contrary the one to the other, that even the Son of God was sent to destroy the works of the devil. Therefore on the contrary side, whosoever resists sin, is the Son of God, being born again of his spirit as of new seed, insomuch that of necessity he is now delivered from the slavery of sin.) He that (John 8:44) commiteth sin, is of the (Resembleth the devil, as the child doth the father, and is governed by his spirit.) devil: for the devil (He saith not sinned, but sinneth, for he did nothing else but sin.) sinneth from the (From the very beginning of the world.) beginning: for this purpose was made manifest that Son of God, that he might loose the works of the devil."},{"number":9,"verse":"Whosoever is born of God sinneth not: for his (The holy Ghost is so called of the effect he worketh, because by his virtue and mighty working, as it were by seed, we are made new men.) seed remaineth in him, neither can he sin, because he is born of God."},{"number":10,"verse":"(The conclusion, by a wicked life they are known which are governed by the spirit of the Devil, and by a pure life, which are God’s children.) In this are the children of God known, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness, is not of God, (He beginneth to commend charity towards the brethren, as another mark of the Sons of God.) neither he that loveth not his brother."},{"number":11,"verse":"(The first reason, taken of the authority of God, which giveth the commandment.) For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that (John 13:34; John 15:12) we should love one another,"},{"number":12,"verse":"(An amplification, taken of the contrary example of Cain, which slew his brother.) Not as Cain which was of that wicked one, and slew his brother: (A short digression: Let us not marvel that we are hated by the world for doing our duty, for such was the condition of Abel who was a just person: and who would not rather be like him than Cain?) and wherefore slew he him? because his own works were evil, and his brother’s good. (He bringeth forth a very fit and very old example, wherein we may behold both the nature of the sons of God, and of the sons of the devil, and what state and condition remaineth for us in this world: and what shall be the end of both at length.) (Gen. 4:8)"},{"number":13,"verse":"Marvel not my brethren, though this world hate you."},{"number":14,"verse":"(The second reason: Because charity is a testimony that we are translated from death to life: and therefore hatred towards the brethren is a testimony of death, and whosoever nourished it, doth as it were foster death in his bosom.) We know that we are (Love is a token that we are translated from death to life, for as such as by the effects the cause is known.) translated from death unto life, because we love the brethren: (1 John 2:10; Lev. 9:17) he that loveth not his brother, abideth in death."},{"number":15,"verse":"(A confirmation: Whosoever is a murderer, is in eternal death, who so hateth his brother, is a murderer, therefore he is in death. And thereupon followeth the contrary. He that loveth his brother, hath passed to life, for indeed we are born dead.) Whosoever hateth his brother, is a manslayer: and ye know that no manslayer hath eternal life abiding in him."},{"number":16,"verse":"(John 15:13; Eph. 5:2) (Now he showeth how far Christian charity extendeth, even so far, that according to the example of Christ, every man forget himself, to provide for and help his brethren.) Hereby have we perceived love, that he laid down his life for us: therefore we ought also to lay down our lives for the brethren."},{"number":17,"verse":"(Luke 3:11) (He reasoneth by comparison: For if we are bound even to give our life for our neighbors, how much more are we bound to help our brothers’ necessity with our goods and substance?) And whosoever hath this (Wherewith this life is sustained.) world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and (Openeth not his heart to him, nor helpeth him willingly and cheerfully.) shutteth up his compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?"},{"number":18,"verse":"(Christian charity standeth not in words, but in deed, and proceedeth from a sincere affection.) My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue only, but in deed and in truth."},{"number":19,"verse":"(He commendeth charity by a triple effect: for first of all, by it we know that we are indeed the sons of God, as he showeth before.) For thereby we know that we are of the truth, (Therefore it cometh that we have a quiet conscience, as on the contrary side he that thinketh that he hath God for a judge, because he is guilty to himself, either he is never or else very rare quiet: for God hath a far quicker sight than we, and judgeth more severely.) and shall before him assure our hearts."},{"number":20,"verse":"For (If an evil conscience convinceth us, much more ought the judgments of God contemn us, who knoweth our hearts better than we ourselves do.) if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things."},{"number":21,"verse":"(A third effect also riseth out of the former, that in these miseries we are sure to be heard, because we are the sons of God, as we understand by the grace of sanctification which is proper to the elect.) Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we boldness toward God."},{"number":22,"verse":"(Matt. 21:22; John 15:7; John 16:25; 1 John 5:14) (The conclusion: That faith in Christ, and love one towards another, are things joined together, and therefore the outward testimonies of sanctification must and do answer that inward testimony of the Spirit given unto us.) And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things which are pleasing in his sight."},{"number":23,"verse":"(John 6:23; John 17:3) This is then his commandment, that we believe in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave commandment."},{"number":24,"verse":"(John 13:34; John 15:10) For he that keepeth his commandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him: and hereby we know that he abideth in us, even by that (He meaneth the Spirit of sanctification whereby we are born anew, and live unto God.) Spirit which he hath given us."}]}
