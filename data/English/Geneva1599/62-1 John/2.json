Let therefore abide in you that same which ye have heard from the beginning.

And this is the sum of the argument: God is the fountain of all righteousness: and therefore they that give themselves to righteousness, are known to be born of him, because they resemble God the Father.) If ye know that he is righteous, know ye that he which doeth righteously, is born of him."}]}
