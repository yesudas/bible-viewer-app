As the Hart brayeth for the rivers of water, so (By these similitudes of thirst and panting, he showeth his fervent desire to serve God in his Temple.) panted my soul after thee, O God."},{"number":2,"verse":"My soul thirsteth for God, even for the living God: when shall I come and appear before the presence of God?"},{"number":3,"verse":"(As others take pleasure in eating and drinking, so he was altogether given to weeping.) Mine tears have been my meat day and night, while they daily say unto me, Where is thy God?"},{"number":4,"verse":"When I remembered (That is, how I led the people to serve thee in thy Tabernacle, and now seeing my contrary estate, I die for sorrow.) these things, I poured out my very heart, because I had gone with the multitude, and led them into the house of God with the voice of singing, and praise, as a multitude that keepeth a feast."},{"number":5,"verse":"Why art thou cast down, my soul, and unquiet within me?
