I thought, (Albeit he had appointed with himself patiently to have tarried Godâ€™s leisure, yet the vehemency of his pain caused him to break his purpose.) I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth bridled, while the wicked is in my sight."},{"number":2,"verse":"I was dumb and spake nothing: I kept silence even from good, (Though when the wicked ruled, he thought to have kept silence, yet his zeal caused him to change his mind.) and my sorrow was more stirred."},{"number":3,"verse":"Mine heart was hot within me, and while I was musing, the fire kindled, and I (He confesseth that he grudged against God, considering the greatness of his sorrows, and the shortness of his life.) spake with my tongue, saying,"},{"number":4,"verse":"Lord, let me know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: let me know how long I have to live."},{"number":5,"verse":"Behold, thou hast made my days as an hand breadth, and mine age as nothing in respect of thee: surely every man in his best state is altogether (Yet David offended in that that he reasoned with God as though that he were too severe toward his weak creature.) vanity.
