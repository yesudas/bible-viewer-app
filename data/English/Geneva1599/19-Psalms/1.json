For the effect hereof is, 1 That they be blessed which give themselves wholly all their life to the holy Scriptures;4 and that the wicked contemners of God, though they seem for a while happy, yet at length shall come to miserable destruction.) ) Blessed is the man that doth not walk in the (When a man hath given once place to evil counsel, or to his own concupiscence, he beginneth to forget himself in his sin, and so falleth into contempt of God, which contempt is called the seat of the scorners.) counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful."},{"number":2,"verse":"But his delight is in the (Cross references: : Deut. 6:6; Josh. 1:8; Prov. 6:10) law of the Lord, and in his (In the holy Scriptures.) law doth he meditate day and night."},{"number":3,"verse":"For he shall be like a (Jer. 17:8) tree planted by the rivers of waters, that will bring forth her fruits in due season: whose leaf shall not fade: so (God’s children are so moistened ever with his grace, that whatsoever cometh unto them, tendeth unto their salvation.) whatsoever he shall do, shall prosper."},{"number":4,"verse":"(Though the wicked seem to bear the swinge in this world, yet the Lord driveth them down that they shall not rise nor stand in the company of the righteous.)
