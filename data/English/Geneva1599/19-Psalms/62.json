And because our minds are easily drawn from God by the allurements of the world, he sharply reproveth this vanity, to the intent he might cleave fast to the Lord.) Yet (Though Satan tempted him to murmur against God, yet he bridled his affections, and resting upon Godâ€™s promise.) my soul keepeth silence unto God; of him cometh my salvation."},{"number":2,"verse":"(It appeareth by the oft repetition of this word, that the Prophet abode manifold tentations, but by resting on God, and by patience he overcame them all.) Yet he is my strength and my salvation, and my defense; therefore I shall not much be moved."},{"number":3,"verse":"How long will ye imagine mischief against a (He meaneth himself, being the man whom God had appointed to the kingdom.) man? ye shall be all slain; ye shall be as a bowed wall, or as a (Though, ye seem to be in honor, yet God will suddenly destroy you.) wall shaken."},{"number":4,"verse":"Yet they consult to cast him down from his dignity; their delight is in lies: they bless with their mouths, but curse with their hearts.

Selah."},{"number":9,"verse":"Yet the children of men are vanity, the chief men are liars: to lay them upon a balance they are altogether lighter than vanity."},{"number":10,"verse":"Trust not in oppression nor in robbery: (Give yourselves wholly to God by putting away all things that are contrary to his Law.) be not vain: if riches increase, set not your heart thereon."},{"number":11,"verse":"God spake (He hath plainly borne witness of his power, so that none needeth to doubt thereof.) once or twice, I have heard it, that power belongeth unto God,"},{"number":12,"verse":"And to thee, O Lord, mercy: for thou (So that the wicked shall feel thy power, and the godly thy mercy.) rewardest everyone according to his work."}]}
