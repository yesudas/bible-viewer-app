Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother, saith the Lord? Yet I loved Jacob,"},{"number":3,"verse":"And I hated Esau, and made his mountains waste, and his heritage a wilderness for dragons. (For beside here the signs of mine hatred appeared even when he was made servant unto his younger brother, being yet in his mother’s belly, and also afterward in that he was put from his birthright, yet even now before your eyes the signs hereof are evident, in that that his country lieth waste and he shall never return to inhabit.) (Whereas ye my people, whom the enemy hated more than them, are by my grace and love toward you delivered, read Rom. 9:13.)"},{"number":4,"verse":"Though Edom say, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places: yet saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will destroy it, and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and the people, with whom the Lord is angry forever."},{"number":5,"verse":"And your eyes shall see it, and ye shall say, The Lord will be magnified upon the border of Israel."},{"number":6,"verse":"A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master. If then I be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear, saith the Lord of hosts unto you, (Besides the rest of the people he condemneth the Priests chiefly, because they should have reproved others for their hypocrisy, and obstinacy against God, and not have hardened them by their example to greater evils.)
