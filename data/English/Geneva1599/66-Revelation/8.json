{"bibleAbbr":"Geneva1599","bookName":"Revelation","bookEnglishName":"Revelation","chapterNumber":8,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"(1 After the opening of the seventh seal,3 the Saints’ prayers are offered up with odors.6 The seven Angels come forth with trumpets.7 The four first blow, and fire falleth on the earth,8 the sea is turned into blood,10, 11 the waters wax bitter.12 and the stars are darkened.) (He returneth to the history of the seals of the book, which the Lamb openeth. The seventh seal is the next foresignification, and a precise commandment of the execution of the most heavy judgments of God upon this wicked world: which foresignification being understood by the seal, all things in heaven are silent, and in horror thorough admiration until commandment of execution be severally given of God unto the ministers of his wrath. So he passeth unto the third member of which I spake before in Rev. 6:1, which is of the execution of those evils wherewith God most justly determined to afflict the world.) And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour."},{"number":2,"verse":"(Now followeth the third branch of the common history, as even now I said: which is the execution of the judgments of God upon the world. This is first generally prepared unto verse 6, then by several parts expoundeth according to the order of those that administered the same unto the end of the Chap. following. Unto the preparation of this execution are declared these things: first, who were the administers and instruments thereof in this verse. Secondly, what is the work both of the Prince of Angels giving order for this execution, thence unto verse 5, and of his administers in verse 6. The administers of the execution are said to be seven Angels: their instruments, trumpets, whereby they should as it were sound the alarm at the commandment of God. They are propounded seven in number, because it pleased God not at once to pour out his wrath upon the rebellious world, but at divers times, and by piecemeal, and in slow order, and as with an unwilling mind to exercise his judgments upon his creatures, so long called upon both by word and signs if happily they had learned to repent.) And I saw the seven Angels, which (Which appear before him as his ministers.) stood before God, and to them were given seven trumpets."},{"number":3,"verse":"(This is the great Emperor, the Lord Jesus Christ our King and Savior: who both maketh intercession to God the Father for the Saints, filling the heavenly Sanctuary with most sweet odor, and offering up their prayers, as the Calves and burnt sacrifices of their lips, in this verse: in such sort as every one of them (so powerful is that sweet savor of Christ, and the efficacy of his sacrifice) are held in reconcilement with God and themselves made most acceptable unto him, verse 4. And then also out of his treasury, and from the same sanctuary poureth forth upon the world the fire of his wrath, adding also divine tokens thereto: and by that means (as of old the Heralds of Rome were wont to do) he proclaimeth war against the rebellious world.) Then another Angel came and stood before the Altar, having a golden censer, and much odors was given unto him, that he should offer with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar, which is before the throne."},{"number":4,"verse":"And the smoke of the odors with the prayers of the Saints, (Our prayers are nothing worth, unless that true and sweet savor of that only oblation be especially and before all things with them, that is to say, unless we being first of all justified through faith in his Son, be acceptable unto him.) went up before God, out of the Angel’s hand."},{"number":5,"verse":"And the Angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the Altar, and cast it into the earth, and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquake."},{"number":6,"verse":"(This is the work of the administers. The Angels the administers of Christ, only by sounding trumpet and voice (for they are only as Heralds) do effectual call forth the instruments of the wrath of God, through his power. Hitherto have been things general. Now followeth the narration of things particular, which the Angels fix in number wrought in their order set out in verse 19 of the next chap., and is concluded with the declaration of the event which followed upon these things done in the world, and in chapters 10 and 11.) Then the seven Angels, which had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to blow the trumpets."},{"number":7,"verse":"(The first execution at the sound of the first Angel upon the earth, that is, the inhabitants of the earth (by Metonymy) and upon all the fruits thereof: as the comparing of this verse with the second member of verse 9 doth not obscurely declare.) So the first Angel blew the trumpet, and there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast into the earth, and the third part of trees was burnt, and all green grass was burnt."},{"number":8,"verse":"(The second execution, upon the sea in this verse and all things that are there in the next verse.) And the second Angel blew the trumpet, and as it were a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea, and the third part of the sea became blood."},{"number":9,"verse":"And the third part of the creatures, which were in the sea, and had life, died, and the third part of ships were destroyed."},{"number":10,"verse":"(The third execution upon the floods and fountains, that is, upon all fresh waters, in this verse: the effect whereof is, that many are destroyed with the bitterness of waters, in the verse following.) Then the third Angel blew the trumpet, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell into the third part of the rivers, and into the fountains of waters."},{"number":11,"verse":"And the name of the star is called (This is spoken by Metaphor of the name of a most bitter herb, and commonly known, unless perhaps a man following those that note the derivation of words had rather expound it adjectively, for that which by reason or bitterness cannot be drunk, or which maketh the liquor into which is poured more bitter than that any man can drink the same.) wormwood: therefore the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter."},{"number":12,"verse":"(The fourth execution upon these lightsome bodies of heaven, which minister unto this inferior world.) And the fourth Angel blew the trumpet, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened: and the day was smitten, that the third part of it could not shine, and likewise the night."},{"number":13,"verse":"(A lamentable prediction or foretelling of those parts of the divine execution which are yet behind: which also is a passage unto the argument of the next Chapter. Of all these things in a manner Christ himself expressly foretold in Luke 12:24, and they are common plagues generally denounced, without particular note of time.) And I beheld, and heard one Angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the sounds to come of the trumpet of the three Angels, which were yet to blow the trumpets."}]}
