And I saw (This part of the vision alludeth unto the sea or large vessel of brass in which the Priests washed themselves in the entrance of the Temple: for in the entrance of the heavenly Temple (as it is called, verse 5) is said to have been a sea of glass, most lightsome and clear, unto the commodity of choice mixed with fire, that is, as containing the treasury of the judgments of God, which he bringeth forth and dispenseth according to his own pleasure: for out of the former, the Priests were cleansed of old and out of this the ungodly are destroyed now, Rev. 4:6.) as it were a glassy sea, mingled with fire, and (That is, the Godly martyrs of Christ, who shall not give place even in miracles unto that beast: of these, see before, Rev. 13:17 and 14:9, 10.) them that had gotten victory of the beast, and of his image, and of his mark, and of the number of his name, (Glorified God, from the particular observation of the weapons and instruments of God’s wrath, floating in the sea of glass.) stand at the glassy sea, having the harps of God,"},{"number":3,"verse":"And they sung (That song of triumph which is Exod. 15:2.) the song of Moses the (So is Moses called for honor’s sake, as it is set forth, Deut. 34:10.) servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, (This song hath two parts, one a confession, but particular in this verse, and general, in the beginning of the next verse: another, a narration of causes belonging to the confession, whereof one kind is eternal in itself, and most present unto the godly in that God is both holy, and alone God, another kind is future and to come, in that the elect taken out of the Gentiles (that is, out of the wicked ones and unbelieving: as Rev. 11:2) were to be brought unto the same state of happiness by the magnificence of the judgment of God, in the next verse.) Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty: just and true are thy ways, King of Saints. (Thy doings.)
