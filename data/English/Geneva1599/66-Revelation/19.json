The transition hath two places, one of praising God for the overthrow done unto Babylon in 4 verses, and another likewise of praise, and Prophetical, for the coming of Christ unto his kingdom, and his most royal marriage with his Church, thence unto the tenth verse. The former praise has three branches, distinguished after the ancient manner of those that sing: … , that is, an invitation or provokement in 2 verses, … , a response or answer in the third verse, and … , a close or joining together in harmony: all which I thought good of purpose to distinguish in this place, lest any man should with Porphyrius, or other like dogs, object to Saint John of the heavenly Church, a childish and idle repetition of speech.) after these things I heard a great voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah, salvation, and glory, and honor, and power be to the Lord our God."},{"number":2,"verse":"For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath condemned the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants shed by her hand."},{"number":3,"verse":"And again they said, (The song of the Antiphony or response, containing an amplification of the praise of God, from the perpetual and most certain testimony of his divine judgment as was done at Sodom and Gomorrah, Gen. 19.) Hallelujah: and that her smoke rose up for evermore."},{"number":4,"verse":"And the four and twenty Elders, and the four beasts fell down, and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah."},{"number":5,"verse":"(The second place of praise as I said verse 1, which first is commanded from God in this verse: and then is in most ample manner pronounced of the creatures, both because they see that kingdom of Christ to come, which most they desire, verse 6, also because they see that the Church is called forth to be brought home: into the house of her husband by holy marriage unto the fellowship of his kingdom, verses 7, 8. Wherefore S. John is commanded to write in a book the Epiphonema , or acclamation joined with a divine testimony, verse 9.) Then a voice came out of the (Out of the temple from God, as Rev. 11:19.) throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great."},{"number":6,"verse":"And I heard (Without the Temple in heaven.) like a voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of strong thunderings, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord that God that Almighty one hath reigned."},{"number":7,"verse":"Let us be glad and rejoice, and give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made (Namely unto that holy marriage both herself in person in this verse and also furnished of her spouse with marriage gifts princely and divine is adorned and prepared in the next verse.) herself ready."},{"number":8,"verse":"And to her was granted, that she should be arrayed with (As an ensign of Kingly and priestly dignity: which dignity Christ bestoweth upon us, Rev. 1:6.) pure fine linen and shining, for the fine (This is a gift given by the husband for marriage sake and a most choice ornament, which Christ bestoweth upon us, as upon his spouse.) linen is the (Good works which are lively testimonies of faith.) righteousness of Saints."},{"number":9,"verse":"(Namely the Angel, as appeareth by the next verse.)

And he said unto me, These words of God are true."},{"number":10,"verse":"(The particular history of this verse is brought in by occasion, and as it were besides the purpose, that Saint John might make a public example of his own infirmity, and of the modest sanctimony of the Angel, who hath renounced for himself the divine honors, and recalled all the servants of God, unto the worship of him alone: as also Rev. 22:8.) And I fell before his feet, (Rev. 22:8) to worship him, but he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow servant, and one of thy brethren, which have the (Which are commanded to bear witness of Jesus.) testimony of Jesus, Worship God: for the testimony of (For Jesus is the mark that all the prophecies shoot at.) Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy."},{"number":11,"verse":"(The second place of this Chapter (as I said verse 1) is of the victory gotten by Christ against both the beasts: in which first Christ is described as one ready to fight, unto verse 16, then is showed the battle to be begun, thence unto verse 18: lastly is set forth the victory unto the end of the Chapter. In this place do shine most excellent properties of Christ as our heavenly Judge and revenger, according to his person, company, effects, and names.) And I saw (Properties belonging to his person, that he is heavenly, judge, faithful, true, just, in this verse, searching out all things ruling over all, to be searched out of none, verse 12, the trumpet, and the very essential word of God, verse 13.) heaven open, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and he judgeth and fighteth righteously."},{"number":12,"verse":"And his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns: and he had a name written, that no man knew but himself."},{"number":13,"verse":"And he was clothed with a garment dipped in blood, and his name is called, THE WORD OF GOD."},{"number":14,"verse":"(The company or retinue of Christ, holy, innumerable, heavenly, judicial, royal and pure.)

And out of his mouth went out a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the heathen: for he shall (Ps. 2:9) rule them with a rod of iron, for he it is that treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."},{"number":16,"verse":"(The name agreeing unto Christ according to the former properties, expressed after the manner of the Hebrews.)
