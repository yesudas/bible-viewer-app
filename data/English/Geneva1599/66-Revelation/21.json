Before the state of the Church described, is set down the state of the whole world, that there shall be a new heaven, and a new earth, as Isa. 65:17 and 66:12 and 2 Pet. 3:13, and this is the seat or place of the Church, in which righteousness shall dwell.) I saw (Cross references: : Isa. 65:17; Isa. 66:22) a new heaven, and a new earth: for the (2 Pet. 3:13) first heaven, and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea."},{"number":2,"verse":"(The state of this glorious Church is first described generally, unto verse 8 and then specially and by parts, in the verses following.

The Angel’s speech describeth the glory of the Church by the most familiar cohabitation of God therewith, by communication of all manner [of] good things according to the covenant, in this verse: and by removing or putting far away of all evil things in the verse following.)
