(The authority of the intended revelation being declared, together with the necessity of that calling, which was particularly imposed upon Saint John: hereafter followeth the history of the estate of Christ’s Church both conflicting or warfaring, and overcoming in Christ. For both the true Church of Christ is said to fight against that which is falsely so called over the which Antichrist ruleth. Christ Jesus overthrowing Antichrist by the spirit of his mouth: and Christ is said to overcome most gloriously until he shall slay the Antichrist by the appearance of his coming, as the Apostle excellently teacheth, 2 Thess. 2:8. So this history hath two parts. One of the state of the Church conflicting with temptations, until Chapter 16. The other of the state of the same Church obtaining victory, thence unto Chapter 20. The first part hath two members most conveniently distributed into their times, whereof the first containeth an history of the Christian Church for 1260 years, what time the Gospel of Christ was as it were taken up from amongst men into heaven: the second containeth an history of the same Church unto the victory perfected. And these two members are briefly, though distinctly propounded in this Chapter, but are both of them more at large discussed after in due order. For we understand the state of the Church conflicting out of Chapters 12 and 13 and of the same growing out of afflictions out of Chapters 14, 15 and 16. Neither did Saint John at unawares join together the history of these two times in this Chapter, because here is spoken of prophecy, which all confess to be one just and innumerable in the Church, and which Christ commanded to be continual. The history of the former time reacheth unto verse 14: the latter is set down in the rest of this Chapter. In the former are showed these things: the calling of the servants of God in 4 verses: the conflicts which the faithful must undergo in their calling, for Christ and his Church, thence unto verse 10, and their resurrection and receiving up into heaven unto verse 14. In the calling of the servants of God are mentioned two things: the begetting and setting of the Church in two verses, and the education thereof in two verses. The begetting of the Church is here commended unto S. John by sign and by speech: the sign is a measuring rod, and the speech a commandment to measure the Temple of God, that is, to reduce the same unto a new form: because the Gentiles are already entered into the Temple of Jerusalem, and shall shortly defile and overthrow the same utterly.) Then was given me a reed like unto a rod, and the Angel stood by, saying, Rise and (Either that of Jerusalem which was a figure of the Church of Christ, or that heavenly Example, whereof verse 19, but the first liketh me better and the things following do agree thereunto. The sense therefore is, Thou seest all things in God’s house almost from the passion of Christ to be disordered: and that not only the city of Jerusalem but also the court of the Temple is trampled underfoot by the nations, and by profane men whether Jews or strangers: and that only the Temple, that is, the body of the Temple, with the Altar, and a small company of good men which truly worship God, do now remain, whom God doth sanctify and confirm by his presence. Measure therefore this, even this true Church, or rather the true type of the true Church, omitting the rest and so describe all things from me that the true Church of Christ may be as it were a very little center, and the Church of Antichrist as the circle of the center, every way in length and breadth compassing about the same, that by way of prophecy thou mayest so declare openly, that the state of the Temple of God and the faithful which worship him, that is, of the Church, is much more straight than the Church of Antichrist.) mete the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that worship therein."},{"number":2,"verse":"(As if he should say, it belongeth nothing unto them to judge those which are without, 1 Cor. 5:12, which be innumerable: look unto those of the household only, or unto the house of the living God.) But the (He speaketh of the outward court, which was called the peoples court, because all men might come into that.) Court which is without the Temple (That is counted to be cast out, which in measuring is refused as profane.) cast out, and mete it not: for it is given unto the (To profane persons wicked and unbelievers, adversaries unto the Church.) Gentiles, and the holy city shall they tread under foot, (Or a thousand and two hundred and threescore days as is said in the next verse: that is a thousand two hundred and threescore years, a day for a year as often in Ezekiel and Daniel, which thing I noted before, 2:10. The beginning of these thousand two hundred and threescore years, we account from the passion of Christ, whereby (the partition wall being broken down) we were made of two one, Eph. 2:14. I say one flock under one Shepherd, John 10:16 and the end of these years precisely falleth into the Popedom of Boniface the eighth who a little before the end of the year of Christ a thousand two hundred ninety four, entered the Popedom of Rome, in the feast of S. Lucie (as Bergomensis saith) having put in prison his predecessor Coelestinus, whom by fraud, under color of oracle, he deceived: for which cause, that well said of him, Intravit ut vulpes, regnavit ut leo, mortuus est ut canis. That is, he entered like a fox, reigned like a lion, and died like a dog. For if from a thousand two hundred ninety four years thou shalt take the age of Christ which he lived on the earth, thou shalt find there remaineth 1260 years, which are mentioned in this place and many others.) two and forty Months."},{"number":3,"verse":"But (I had rather translate it illud than illam, the Temple than the city: for God saith, I will give that Temple, and commit it unto my two witnesses, that is unto the Ministers of the word, who are few indeed, weak and contemptible: but yet two, that is, of such a number as one of them may help another, and one confirm the testimony of another unto all men, that from the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be made good amongst men, 2 Cor. 13:1.) I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall (They shall exercise their office enjoined by me by the space of those thousand two hundred and sixty years, in the midst of afflictions though never so lamentable which is figuratively showed by the mourning garment.) prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth."},{"number":4,"verse":"These (That is, the ordinary and perpetual instruments of spiritual grace, peace and light in my Church, which God by his only power preserved in this Temple.

And this is the second place (as I said before) of the combats which the servants of God must needs undergo in the executing of their calling, and of the things that follow the same combats. In the combats or conflicts are these things: to overcome, in these two verses: to be overcome and killed, verse 7. After the slaughter follow these things, that the carcasses of the godly are laid abroad, verse 8 being unburied, are made a matter of scorn together of cursing and bitter execrations, verse 9, and that therefore gratulations are publicly and privately made, verse 10.) And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouths and devoureth their enemies: for if any man would hurt them, thus must he be killed."},{"number":6,"verse":"These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophesying, and have power over waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with all manner plagues, as often as they will."},{"number":7,"verse":"(That is, when they have spent those thousand two hundred and sixty years, mentioned verses 2 and 3, in publishing their testimony according to their office.) And when they have (When they have done their message.) finished their testimony, (Of which after Rev. 13.

And that this was done to very many godly men by Boniface and others, the histories do declare, especially since the time that the odious and condemned name amongst the multitude first of the brethren Waldenses or Lugdunenses, then also of the Fratricels, was pretended, that good men might with more approbation be massacred.) overcome them, and kill them,"},{"number":8,"verse":"And their corpses shall lie in the (That is, openly at Rome: where at that time was a most great concourse of people, the year of Jubilee being then first ordained by Boniface unto the same end, in the year of Christ a thousand three hundred, example whereof is read, Rev. 1. Extra, de penitentys & remissionibus. So by one act he committed double injury against Christ, both abolishing his truth by the restoring of the type of the Jubilee, and triumphing over his members by most wicked superstitions. O religious heart! Now that we should understand the things of Rome, Saint John himself is the author, both after in the seventeenth Chapter almost throughout, and also in the circumscription now next following, when he saith, it is that great City (as Rev. 17; 18 he calleth it) and is spiritually termed Sodom and Egypt: that spiritually (for that must here again be repeated from before) Christ was there crucified. For the two first appellations signify spiritual wickednesses: the latter signifieth the show and pretence of good, that is, of Christian and sound religion. Sodom signifieth most licentious impiety and injustice: Egypt most cruel persecution of the people of God: and Jerusalem signifieth the most confident glorying of that city, as it were in true religion, being yet full of falsehood and ungodliness. Now who is ignorant that these things do rather, and more agree unto Rome than unto any other city? The commendations of the City of Rome for many years past are publicly notorious, which are not for me to gather. This only I will say that he long since did very well see what Rome is, who taking his leave thereof, used these verses:Roma vale, vidi, Satis est vidisse: revertar, Quumleno, meretrix, scurra, cinadus ero. Now farewell Rome, I have thee seen: It was enough to see:I will return when as I mean, bawd, harlot knave to be.) streets of the great city, which (After a most secret kind of meaning and understanding.) spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, (Namely in his members, as also he said unto Saul, Acts 9:5.) where our Lord also was crucified."},{"number":9,"verse":"And they of the people and kindreds, and tongues, and Gentiles, shall see their corpses (That is, for three years and a half for so many years Boniface lived after his Jubilee as Bergomensis witnesseth.) three days and an half, and shall not suffer their carcasses to be put in graves."},{"number":10,"verse":"And they that dwell upon the earth, (So much the more shall they by this occasion exercise the jollity of their Jubilee.) shall rejoice over them and be glad, and shall send gifts one to another, for these two Prophets (The gospel of Christ, in the affliction of the world, and the ministry thereof, the savor of death unto death to those that perish, 2 Cor. 2:16.) vexed them that dwelt on the earth."},{"number":11,"verse":"(The third place as noted I before, is of the rising again of the Prophets from the dead, and their carrying up into heaven.

John expressed before verses 5 and 6. And so the prophecy that is spoken of Elijah, is interpreted by the Angel to be understood of John the Baptist, Luke 1:17. For the same Boniface himself, who sought to kill and destroy them, was by the fire of God’s mouth (which the holy ministry showeth and exhibiteth) devoured and died miserably in prison, by the endeavor of Satra Columensis, and Nogaretus a french knight, whom Philip the fair King of France sent into Italy but with a small power.) the spirit of life coming from God, shall enter into them, and they (That is, the most grievous heat of afflictions and persecution shall stay for a while, for the great amaze that shall arise upon that sudden and unlooked for judgment of God.) shall stand up upon their feet: and great fear shall come upon them which saw them."},{"number":12,"verse":"And they shall hear a great voice from heaven, saying unto them, (They were called by God into heaven and taken out of this malignant world, into the heavenly Church, which also lieth hidden here in the earth, to exercise their calling secretly: as of whom this wretched world was unworthy, Heb. 11:38. For the Church of the wicked is by comparison called the earth or the world: and the Church of the godly heaven.

Andrew, so great an earthquake arose, as never before: which also continuing, by times, for many days, overthrew many stately houses. This saith he of the year next following the Jubilee: which S. John so many ages before, expressed word for word.) And the same hour shall there be a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city shall fall, and in the earthquake shall be slain in number seven thousand: and the remnant were sore feared, (They were indeed broken with present astonishment of mind, but did not earnestly repent as they ought to have done.) and (Glorified God by confessing his name.) gave glory to God of heaven."},{"number":14,"verse":"(He passeth unto the second history: which is the second part of this Chapter.

In this history there are three branches: a preparation by the sound of the Angels trumpet: a narration by the voice of heavenly Angels and Elders: and a confirmation by sign.) And the seventh Angel blew the trumpet, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, (The narration hath two parts: an acclamation of the heavenly creatures, in this verse, and both an adoration by all the Elders, verse 16, and also a most ample thanksgiving, verses 17, 18. The sense of the acclamation is, Now the Lord is entered on his kingdom, and hath restored his Church, in which most mightily recovered from the profanation of the Gentiles, he may glorify himself. Namely, that which the Lord ordained when first he ordained his Church, that the faith of the Saints doth now behold as accomplished.)
