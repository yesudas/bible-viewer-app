This place must necessarily be joined with the end of chapter 12 and be applied unto the just understanding thereof. This chapter hath two parts, one of the dragon overcome, unto verse 10, the other of the resurrection and last judgment unto the end of the chapter. The history of the dragon is double: First of the first victory after which he was bound by Christ unto verse 6. The second is of the last victory, whereby he has thrown down into everlasting punishment, thence unto verse 10. This first history happened in the first time of the Christian Church, when the dragon thrown down from heaven by Christ, went about to molest the new birth of the Church in the earth, Rev. 12:17, 18. For which cause I gave warning, that this story of the Dragon must be annexed unto that place.) I saw an Angel come down from heaven, having the key (That is of hell, whither God threw down the Angels which had sinned, and bound them in chains of darkness to be kept unto damnation, 2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 6.) of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand."},{"number":2,"verse":"And he took the dragon that old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and he bound him (The first whereof (continuing this history with the end of chapter 12) is the 36 year from the passion of Christ, when the Church of the Jews being overthrown, Satan assayed to invade the Christian Church gathered of the Gentiles, and to destroy part of her seed, Rev. 12:17. The thousandth year falleth precisely upon the times of that wicked Hildebrand, who was called Gregory the seventh a most damnable Necromancer and sorcerer, whom Satan used as an instrument when he was loosed out of bonds, thenceforth to annoy the Saints of God with most cruel persecutions, and the whole world with dissentions, and most bloody wars: as Benno the Cardinal reporteth at large. This is the first victory gotten over the dragon in the earth.) a thousand years:"},{"number":3,"verse":"And cast him into the bottomless pit, and he shut him up, and sealed the door upon him, that he should deceive the people (Namely, with that public and violent deceit which he attempted before, Chapter 12, and which after a thousand years (alack for woe) he most mightily procured in the Christian world.) no more till the thousand years were fulfilled: for after that he must be loosed for (Which being once expired, the second battle and victory shall be, of which verses 7, 8.) a little season."},{"number":4,"verse":"(A description of the common state of the Church of Christ in earth in that space of a thousand years, for which the devil was in bonds: in which first the authority, life, and common honor of the godly, is declared, verse 4. Secondly, newness of life is preached unto others by the Gospel, after that space, verse 5. Finally, he concludeth with promises, verse 6.) And I saw seats: and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them, and I saw the souls of them that were (Of the Martyrs, which suffered in those first times.) beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which (Of the Martyrs which suffered after that both the beasts were now risen up, Chapter 13, for these three things are expounded.) did not worship the beast, neither his image, neither had taken his mark upon their foreheads or on their hands: and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (For judgment was committed to them, as to members joined to the head, not [that] Christâ€™s office was given over [to] them.)

But the rest of the dead men (They shall not be renewed with that newness of the life by the enlightening of the Gospel of the glory of Christ. For this is the first resurrection, by which the souls of the godly do rise from their death. In the second resurrection their bodies shall rise again.) shall not live again, until the thousand years be finished: this is the first resurrection."},{"number":6,"verse":"Blessed and holy is he, that hath part in the first resurrection: for on such the (That whereby both body and soul, that is, the whole man is addicted and delivered unto eternal death. So Rev. 2:11.) second death hath no power: but they shall be the Priests of God and of Christ, (A return unto the intended history, by resuming the words which are in the end of the fourth verse.) and shall reign with him a thousand years."},{"number":7,"verse":"(The second history, of the latter victory of Christ, as was said verse 1. In which are summarily described the work, overthrow and eternal punishment of Satan.) And when the (Of which I spake, verse 2.

And the devil that deceived them, was cast into a lake of fire and brimstone, where that beast and that false prophet are, and shall be tormented even day and night for evermore."},{"number":11,"verse":"(The second part of this Chapter, in which is described the judge, in this verse, and the last judgment in the verse following.) And I saw a great (That is, a tribunal seat most Princelike and glorious: for so doth the Greek word also signify.) white throne, and one that sat on it, (That is, Christ, before whom when he cometh unto judgment, heaven and earth shall perish for the greatness of his majesty, 2 Pet. 3:7, 10, etc.) from whose face fled away both the earth and heaven, and their place was no more found."},{"number":12,"verse":"And I saw the dead, both great and small stand before (That is, Christ the judge, 2 Cor. 5:10.)
