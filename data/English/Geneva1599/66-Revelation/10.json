And (Now Saint John passeth unto the other Prophetical history, which is of the Church of God, as I showed that this book should be distinguished, Rev. 4:1. This story reacheth hence unto the two and twentieth Chapter. And this whole Chapter is but a transition from the common history of the world unto that which is particular of the Church. There are in this transition or passage, two preparatives as it were, unto this Church story comprised in this whole Chapter. One is the authority of Christ revealing his mysteries, and calling his servants unto the seventh verse. The other is Saint John’s calling, proper unto this place, and prepared from before unto the end of this chapter. Authority is given unto this Revelation by these things: First, by the appearing from heaven in this habit and countenance, strong, ready, glorious, surveying all things by his providence and governing them by his omnipotence, the first verse. Secondly, that he brought not by chance, but out of a book, this open Revelation, set forth unto the eye, to signify the same unto the sea, and land, as the Lord over all, the second Verse. Thirdly, that he offered the same not whispering or muttering in a corner (as false prophets do) but crying out with a loud voice unto them which sleep, and with a lionish and terrible noise roused the secure: the very thunders themselves giving testimony thereunto, the third Verse. Lastly, for that he confirmed all by an oath, Verses 5, 6, 7.) I saw (Christ Jesus, see the seventh Chapter and the second verse.) another mighty Angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire."},{"number":2,"verse":"And he had in his hand a (Namely, a special book of the affairs of God’s Church. For the book that containeth things belonging [unto] the whole world, is said to be kept with the Creator, the fifth Chapter and the first verse, but the book of the Church, with the Redeemer: and out of this book is taken the rest of the history of this Apocalypse.) little book open, and he put his right foot upon the sea, and his left on the earth,"},{"number":3,"verse":"And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices."},{"number":4,"verse":"(A godly care is laudable, but must be joined with knowledge. Therefore nothing is to be taken in hand, but by calling: which must be expected and waiting for of the godly.) And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: but I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, (Keep them close.) Seal up those things which the seven thunders have spoken, and write them not."},{"number":5,"verse":"And the Angel which I saw stand upon the sea, and upon the earth, (This was a gesture used of one that sweareth, which men do nowadays use.) lift up his hand to heaven,"},{"number":6,"verse":"And sware by him that liveth for evermore, which created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things that therein are, (Neither time itself, nor the things that are in time: but that the world to come is at hand which is altogether of eternity and beyond all times.) that (There shall never be anymore time.) time should be no more."},{"number":7,"verse":"But in the days of the (Whereof Rev. 11:15 and 16:17.) voice of the seventh Angel, when he shall begin to blow the trumpet, even the mystery of God shall be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the Prophets."},{"number":8,"verse":"(The other part of this Chapter, concerning the particular calling of Saint John to the receiving of the prophecy following which is enjoined him, first by sign in three verses, then in plain words in the last verse. Unto the setting forth of the sign belong these things: That Saint John is taught from heaven to demand the book of the Prophecy in this verse: for these motions and desires God doth inspire: that demanding the book, he is charged to take it in a figurative manner, the use whereof also is expounded, the ninth verse, (as in the second Chapter of Ezekiel and the ninth verse) whence this similitude is borrowed: lastly, for that Saint John at the commandment of Christ took the book, and found by experience that the same as proceeding from Christ was most sweet, but in that it foretelleth the afflictions of the Church it was most bitter unto his spirit.) And the voice which I heard from heaven, spake unto me again, and said, Go, and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel, which standeth upon the sea, and upon the earth."},{"number":9,"verse":"So I went unto the Angel, and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth as sweet as honey."},{"number":10,"verse":"Then I took the little book out of the Angel’s hand, and ate it up, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey: but when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter."},{"number":11,"verse":"(A simple and plain declaration of the sign before going, witnessing the divine calling of S. John, and laying upon him the necessity thereof.) And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again among the people and nations, and tongues, and to many Kings."}]}
