And (Sin is the beginning even of all bodily diseases, and yet doth it not follow, that God always respecteth their sins, whom he most sharply punisheth.) as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth."},{"number":2,"verse":"And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?"},{"number":3,"verse":"Jesus answered, (Christ reasoneth here, as his disciples thought, which presuppose that there come no diseases but for sins only: whereupon he answereth that there was another cause of this man’s blindness, and that was, that God’s his work might be seen.) Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God should be showed on him."},{"number":4,"verse":"(The works of Christ are as it were a light, which lighten the darkness of the world.) I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is (By (day) is meant the light, that is, the lightsome, doctrine of the heavenly truth: and by (night) is meant the darkness which cometh by the obscurity of the same doctrine.) day: the night cometh when no man can work."},{"number":5,"verse":"As long as I am in the world, (Cross references: : John 1:9; John 8:12; John 12:35) I am the light of the world."},{"number":6,"verse":"(Christ healing the man born blind, by taking the sign of clay, and afterward the sign of the fountain of Siloam (which signifieth Sent) showeth that as he at the beginning made man, so doth he again restore both his body and soul: and yet so, that he himself cometh first of his own accord to heal us.)
