offering that the prince shall offer unto the Lord on the Sabbath day, shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish."},{"number":5,"verse":"And the meat offering shall be an Ephah for

of the North gate to worship, shall go out by the way of the South gate: and he that entereth by the way of the South gate, shall go forth by the way of the North gate: he shall not return by the way
