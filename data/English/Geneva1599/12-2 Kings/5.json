He also was a mighty man and valiant, but a leper."},{"number":2,"verse":"And the Aramites had gone out by bands, and had taken a little maid of the land of Israel, and she (Hebrew, she was before.) served Naaman’s wife."},{"number":3,"verse":"And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the (Meaning, Elisha.) Prophet that is in Samaria, he would soon deliver him of his leprosy."},{"number":4,"verse":"And (That is, Naaman told it to the king of Syria.) he went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus saith the maid that is of the land of Israel."},{"number":5,"verse":"And the king of Aram said, Go thy way thither, and I will send a letter unto the King of Israel.

Go in peace. So he departed from him about half a day’s journey of ground."},{"number":20,"verse":"And Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God said, Behold, my master hath spared this Aramite Naaman, receiving not those things at his hand that he brought: As the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him."},{"number":21,"verse":"So Gehazi followed speedily after Naaman.

Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is this a time to take money, and to receive garments, (That is, money to buy possessions with: meaning, that it is detestable in the servants of God to have covetous minds.) and olives, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?"},{"number":27,"verse":"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and to thy (To be an example to all such, as by whose covetousness God’s word might be slandered.) seed forever.
