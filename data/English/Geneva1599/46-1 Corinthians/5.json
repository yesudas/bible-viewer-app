It (They are greatly to be reprehended which by suffering of wickedness, set forth the Church of God to be mocked and scorned as the infidels.) is heard certainly that there is fornication among you: and such fornication as is not once named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife."},{"number":2,"verse":"(There are none more proud, than they that least know themselves.) And ye are puffed up, and have not rather sorrowed, that he which hath done this deed, might be put from among you."},{"number":3,"verse":"(Excommunication ought not to be committed to one man’s power, but must be done by the authority of the whole Congregation, after that the matter is diligently examined.) For I verily as absent in body, but present in (In mind, thought, and will.) spirit, have determined already as though I were present, that he that hath thus done this thing,"},{"number":4,"verse":"When ye are gathered together, and my spirit, in the (Calling upon Christ his Name.) Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that such one, I say, (There is no doubt but that judgment is ratified in heaven, wherein Christ himself sitteth as Judge.) by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"},{"number":5,"verse":"(The excommunicate is delivered to the power of Satan, in that, that he is cast out of the house of God.) Be (What it is to be delivered to Satan, the Lord himself declareth when he saith, Let him be unto thee as an Heathen and Publican, Matt 18:17, that is to say, to be disfranchised, and put out of the right and liberty of the city of Christ, which is the Church, without which Satan is lord and master.) delivered unto Satan, for the (The end of excommunication is not to cast away the excommunicate, that he should utterly perish, but that he may be saved, to wit, that by this means his flesh may be tamed, that he may learn to live to the Spirit.) destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."},{"number":6,"verse":"(Another end of excommunication is, that others be not infected, and therefore it must of necessity be retained in the Church, that the one be not infected by the other.) Your rejoicing (Is naught, and not grounded upon good reason, as though you were excellent, and yet there is such wickedness found amongst you.) is not good: know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?"},{"number":7,"verse":"(By alluding to the ceremony of the Passover, he exhorteth them to cast out that unclean person from amongst them. In times past, saith he, it was not lawful for them which did celebrate the Passover, to eat leavened bread: insomuch that he was holden as unclean and unworthy to eat the Passover, whosoever had but tasted of leaven. Now our whole life must be as it were the feast of unleavened bread, wherein all they that are partakers of that immaculate Lamb which is slain, must cast out both of themselves, and also out of their houses and Congregations all impurity.) Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new (By lump he meaneth the whole body of the Church, every member whereof must be unleavened bread, that is, be renewed in spirit, by plucking away the old corruption.) lump, as ye are unleavened: for Christ our (The Lamb of our Passover.) Passover is sacrificed for us."},{"number":8,"verse":"Therefore let us keep the (Let us lead our whole life, as it were a continual feast, honestly and uprightly.) feast, not with old leaven, neither in the leaven of maliciousness and wickedness: but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."},{"number":9,"verse":"(Now he speaketh more generally; and that which he spake before of the incestuous person, he showeth that it pertaineth to others, which are known to be wicked, and such as through their naughty life are a slander to the Church, which ought also by lawful order be cast out of the community of the Church. And making mention of eating meat, either he meaneth those feasts of love whereat the Supper of the Lord was received, or else their common usage and manner of life which is rightly to be taken, lest any man should think that either matrimony were broken by excommunication, or such duties hindered and cut off thereby, as we owe one to another: children to their parents, subjects to their rulers, servants to their masters, and neighbor to neighbor, to win one another to God.) I wrote unto you in an Epistle, that ye should not company together with fornicators,"},{"number":10,"verse":"And not (If you should utterly abstain from such men’s company, you should go out of the world: therefore I speak of them which are in the very bosom of the Church, which must be called home by discipline, and not of them which are without, with whom we must labor by all means possible, to bring them to Christ.) altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or with extortioners, or with idolaters: for then ye must go out of the world."},{"number":11,"verse":"But now I have written unto you, that ye company not together: if any that is called a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such one eat not."},{"number":12,"verse":"(Such as are false brethren, ought to be cast out of the Congregation: as for them which are without, they must be left to the judgment of God.)
