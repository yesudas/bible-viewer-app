On the other side, the inferior sort envied the better, and went about to make a departure, so that all that body was as it were scattered and rent in pieces. So then he going about to remedy these abuses, willeth them first to consider diligently, that they have not these gifts of themselves, but from the free grace and liberality of God, to whose glory they ought to bestow them all.) concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you (Ignorant to what purpose those gifts are given you.) ignorant."},{"number":2,"verse":"(He proveth the same by comparing their former state with that wherein they were at this time endued with those excellent gifts.)

Therefore all must remain coupled together, that the body may remain in safety.) If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?"},{"number":18,"verse":"But now hath God disposed the members every one of them in the body at his own pleasure."},{"number":19,"verse":"For if they were all one member, where were the body?"},{"number":20,"verse":"But now are there many members, yet but one body."},{"number":21,"verse":"(Now on the other side, he speaketh unto them which were endued with more excellent gifts, willing them not to despise the inferiors as unprofitable, and as though they served to no use: for God, saith he, hath in such sort tempered this inequality, that the more excellent and beautiful members can in no wise lack the more abject and such as we are ashamed of, and that they should have more care to see unto them, and to cover them: that by this means the necessity which is on both parts, might keep the whole body in peace and concord: that although if each part be considered apart, they are of divers degrees and conditions, yet because they are joined together, they have a community both in commodities and discommodities.)
