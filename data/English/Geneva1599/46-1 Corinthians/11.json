Be (Cross references: : 2 Thess. 3:9) ye followers of me, even as I am of Christ:"},{"number":2,"verse":"(The fifth treatise of this epistle concerning the right ordering of public assemblies, containing three points, to wit, of the comely apparel of men and women, of the order of the Lord’s supper, and of the right use of spiritual gifts. But going about to reprehend certain things, he beginneth notwithstanding with a general praise of them, calling those particular laws of comeliness and honesty, which belong to the ecclesiastical policy, traditions: which afterward they called Canons.) Now brethren, I commend you, that ye remember all my things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you."},{"number":3,"verse":"(He setteth down God, in Christ our mediator, for the end and mark not only of doctrine, but also of ecclesiastical comeliness. Then applying it to the question proposed, touching the comely apparel both of men and women in public assemblies, he declareth that the woman is one degree beneath the man by the ordinance of God, and that the man is so subject to Christ, that the glory of God ought to appear in him for the preeminence of the sex.) But I will that ye know, that Christ is the (Eph. 5:23) head of every man: and the man is the woman’s head: and God is (In that, that Christ is our mediator.) Christ’s head."},{"number":4,"verse":"(Hereof he gathereth that if men do either pray or preach in public assemblies having their heads covered (which was then a sign of subjection) they did as it were spoil themselves of their dignity, against God’s ordinance.) Every (It appeareth that this was a political law serving only for the circumstances of the time that Paul lived in, by this reason, because in these our days for a man to speak bareheaded in an assembly, is a sign of subjection.) man praying or prophesying having anything on his head, dishonoreth his head."},{"number":5,"verse":"(And in like sort he concludeth, that women which show themselves in public and ecclesiastical assemblies without the sign and token of their subjection, that is to say, uncovered, shame themselves.) But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth bareheaded, dishonoreth her head: (The first argument taken from the common sense of man, forsomuch as nature teacheth women, that it is dishonest for them to come abroad bareheaded, seeing that she hath given them thick and long hair, which they do so diligently trim and deck, that they can in no wise abide to have it shaven.) for it is even one very thing, as though she were shaven."},{"number":6,"verse":"Therefore if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: and if it be shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered."},{"number":7,"verse":"(The taking away of an objection: Have not men also hair given to them? I grant, saith the Apostle, but there is another matter in it: For man was made to this end and purpose, that the glory of God should appear in his rule and authority: but the woman was made, that by profession of her obedience, she might more honor her husband.) For a man ought not to cover his head: forasmuch as he is the (Gen. 1:26; Gen. 5:1; Gen. 9:6; Col. 3:10) image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man."},{"number":8,"verse":"(He proveth the inequality of the woman, by that, that the man is the matter whereof woman was first made.) For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man."},{"number":9,"verse":"(Gen. 2:22) (Secondly, by that, that the woman was made for man, and not the man for the woman’s sake.) For the man was not created for the woman’s sake: but the woman for the man’s sake."},{"number":10,"verse":"(The conclusion: Women must be covered, to show by this external sign their subjection.) Therefore ought the woman to have (A covering which is a token of subjection.) power on her head, because of the (What this meaneth, I do not yet understand.) Angels."},{"number":11,"verse":"(A digression which the Apostle useth, lest that which he spake of the superior tie of men, and the lower degrees of women in consideration of the policy of the Church, should be so taken as though there were no measure of this inequality. Therefore he teacheth that men have in such sort the preeminence, that God made them not alone, but women also: and woman was so made of man, that men also are born by the means of women, and this ought to put them in mind to observe the degree of every sex, in such sort that mutual conjunction may be cherished.) Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man (By the Lord.) in the Lord."},{"number":12,"verse":"For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman: but all things are of God."},{"number":13,"verse":"(He urgeth the argument taken from the common sense of nature.) Judge in yourselves, Is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?"},{"number":14,"verse":"Doth not nature itself teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"},{"number":15,"verse":"But if a woman have long hair, it is a praise unto her: for her hair is given her for a (To be a covering for her, and such a covering as should procure another.) covering."},{"number":16,"verse":"(Against such as are stubbornly contentious we have to oppose this, that the Churches of God are not contentious.) But if any man list to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the Churches of God."},{"number":17,"verse":"¶ (He passeth now to the next treatise concerning the right administration of the Lord’s Supper. And the Apostle useth this sharper preface that the Corinthians might understand, that whereas they observed generally the Apostle’s commandments, yet they foully neglected them in a matter of greatest importance.) Now in this that I declare, I praise you not, that ye come together, not with profit, but with hurt."},{"number":18,"verse":"(To celebrate the Lord’s Supper aright, it is required that there be not only consent of doctrine, but also of affections, that it be not profaned.) For first of all, when ye come together in the Church, I hear that there are dissensions among you: and I believe it to be true in some part."},{"number":19,"verse":"(Although that schisms and heresies proceed from the devil, are evil, and yet they come not by chance, nor without cause, and they turn to the profit of the elect.) For there must be heresies even among you, that they which are (Whom experience hath taught to be of sound Religion and godliness.) approved among you, might be known."},{"number":20,"verse":"When ye come together therefore into one place, this is (This is an usual kind of speech, whereby the Apostle denieth that flatly, which many did not well.) not to eat the Lord’s Supper."},{"number":21,"verse":"For every man when they should eat, taketh his own supper (Eateth his meat and tarrieth not till other come.) afore, and one is hungry, and another is drunken."},{"number":22,"verse":"(The Apostle thinketh it good to take away the love feasts, for their abuse, although they had been a long time, and with commendation used in Churches, and were appointed and instituted by the Apostles.) Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? despise ye the Church of God, and shame them that have not? what shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not."},{"number":23,"verse":"(We must take a true form of keeping the Lord’s Supper, out of the institution of it, the parts whereof are these, touching the Pastors, to show forth the Lord’s death, by preaching his word: to bless the bread and the wine by calling upon the name of God, and together with prayers to declare the institution thereof, and finally to deliver the bread broken to be eaten, and the cup received to be drunk with thanksgiving. And touching the flock, that every man examine himself, that is to say, to prove both his knowledge, and also faith and repentance: to show forth the Lord’s death, that is, in true faith to yield unto his word and institution: and last of all, to take the bread at the Minister’s hand, and to eat it and to drink the wine, and give God thanks: This was Paul’s and the Apostles’ manner of ministering.) For I have received of the Lord that which I also have delivered unto you, to wit, That the Lord Jesus in the night when he was betrayed, took bread."},{"number":24,"verse":"(Matt. 25:26; Mark 14:21; Luke 22:19) And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is (This word (Broken) noteth out unto us Christ his manner of death, for although his legs were not broken, as the thieves legs were, yet was his body very sore tormented, and torn, and bruised.) broken for you: this do ye in remembrance of me."},{"number":25,"verse":"After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the New Testament in my blood: this do as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me."},{"number":26,"verse":"For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye show the Lord’s death till he come."},{"number":27,"verse":"(Whoever contemn the holy Sacrament: that is, use them not aright, are guilty not of the bread and wine, but of the thing itself, that is of Christ, and shall be grievously punished for it.) Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink the cup of the Lord (Otherwise then meet is such mysteries should be handled.) unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."},{"number":28,"verse":"(1 Cor. 13:5) (The examination of a man’s self, is of necessity required in the Supper and therefore they ought not to be admitted unto it, which cannot examine themselves: as children, furious and mad men, also such as either have no knowledge of Christ, or not sufficient, although they profess Christian Religion: and others such like.) Let (This place beateth down the faith of credit, or unwrapped faith, which the Papists maintain.) every man therefore examine himself, and so let them eat of this bread, and drink of this cup."},{"number":29,"verse":"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh his own damnation, because he (He is said to discern the Lord’s body, that hath consideration of the worthiness of it, and therefore cometh to eat of this meat with great reverence.) discerneth not the Lord’s body."},{"number":30,"verse":"(The profaning of the body and blood of the Lord in his mysteries is sharply punished of him, and therefore such a mischief ought diligently to be prevented by judging and correcting of a man’s self.)

Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another."},{"number":34,"verse":"(The Supper of the Lord was instituted not to feed the belly but to feed the soul with the communion of Christ, and therefore it ought to be separate from common banquets.) And if any man be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye come not together unto condemnation. (Such things as pertain to order, as place, time, form of prayers, and other such like, the Apostle took order for in Congregations according to the consideration of times, places and persons.) Other things will I set in order when I come."}]}
