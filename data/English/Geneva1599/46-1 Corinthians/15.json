In the mean season he compareth himself to such sort after a certain divine art with certain others, that he maketh himself inferior to them all.) And last of all he was seen also of me, as of one born out of due time."},{"number":9,"verse":"(Eph. 3:8) For I am the least of the Apostles, which am not meet to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God."},{"number":10,"verse":"(Eph. 3:7) But by the grace of God I am that I am: and his grace which is in me, was not in vain: but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which is with me."},{"number":11,"verse":"Wherefore, whether it were I, or they, so we preach, and so have ye believed."},{"number":12,"verse":"¶ (The first argument to prove that there is a resurrection from the dead: Christ is risen again, therefore the dead shall rise again.) Now if it be preached, that Christ is risen from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?"},{"number":13,"verse":"(The second by an absurdity, If there is no resurrection of the dead, then is not Christ risen again.) For if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:"},{"number":14,"verse":"(The proof of that absurdity by other absurdities: If Christ be not risen again, the preaching of the Gospel is in vain, and the credit that you gave unto it is vain, and we are liars.) And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain."},{"number":15,"verse":"And we are found also false witnesses of God: for we have testified of God, that he hath raised up Christ: whom he hath not raised up, if so be the dead be not raised."},{"number":16,"verse":"(He repeateth the same argument taken of an absurdity, purposing to show how faith is in vain if the resurrection of Christ be taken away.) For if the dead be not raised, then is Christ not raised."},{"number":17,"verse":"And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain: (First, seeing death is the punishment of sin, in vain should we believe that our sins were forgiven us, if they remain: but they do remain, if Christ rose not from death.) ye are (They are yet in their sins, which are not sanctified, nor have obtained remission of their sins.) yet in your sins."},{"number":18,"verse":"(Secondly, unless that this be certain that Christ rose again, all they which died in Christ, are perished. So then what profit cometh of faith?) And so they which are asleep in Christ, are perished."},{"number":19,"verse":"(The third argument, which is also taken from an absurdity: for unless there be another life, wherein such as trust and believe in Christ shall be blessed, they were the most miserable of all creatures, because in this life they are the most miserable.) If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable."},{"number":20,"verse":"(A conclusion of the former argument: Therefore Christ is risen again.) But now is Christ risen from the dead, (He putteth the last conclusion for the first proposition of the argument that followeth. Christ is risen again, Therefore shall we the faithful (for of them he speaketh) rise again: Then followeth the first reason of this consequent: for Christ is set forth unto us, to be considered of, not as a private man apart and by himself, but as the firstfruits: And he taketh that which was known, to all men, to wit, that the whole heap is sanctified in the firstfruits.) and was made the firstfruits of them that slept. (He alludeth to the firstfruits of corn, the offering whereof sanctified the rest of the fruits.) (Col. 1:18; Rev. 1:5)"},{"number":21,"verse":"(Another confirmation of the same consequent: for Christ is to be considered as opposite to Adam, that as from one man Adam, sin came over all, so from one man Christ, life cometh unto all: that is to say, that all the faithful, as they die, because by nature they were born of Adam, so because in Christ they are made the children of God by grace, they are quickened and restored to life by him.)

Then by this occasion he passeth in the next argument.) But every man in his (1 Thess. 4:13) own order: the firstfruits is Christ, afterward, they that are of Christ, at his coming shall rise again."},{"number":24,"verse":"(The fourth argument, wherewith also he confirmeth the others, hath a most sure ground, to wit, because that God must reign. And this is the manner of his reign, that the Father will be showed to be King in his Son who was made man, to whom all things are made subject (the promiser only except) to the end that the Father may afterward triumph in his Son the conqueror. And he maketh two parts of this reign and dominion of the Son, wherein the Father’s glory consisteth: to wit, the overcoming of his enemies (whereof some must be deprived of all power, as Satan and all the wicked, be they never so proud and mighty, and others must be utterly abolished as death) and a plain and full delivery of the godly from all enemies, that by this means God may fully set forth the body of the Church, cleaving fast to their head Christ, his kingdom and glory as a king in his subjects. Moreover he putteth the first degree of this kingdom in the resurrection of the Son, who is the head: and the perfection, in the full conjunction of the members with the head, which shall be in the latter day. Now all these tend to this purpose, to show that unless the dead do rise again, neither the Father can be King above all, neither Christ be Lord of all: for neither should the power of Satan and death be overcome, nor the glory of God be full in his Son, nor his Son in his members.) Then shall be the (The shutting up and finishing of all things.) end, when he hath delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he hath put down (All his enemies which shall be spoiled of all the power they have.) all rule, and all authority and power."},{"number":25,"verse":"For he must reign (Ps. 110:1; Acts 2:34; Heb. 1:13; Heb. 10:13) till he hath put all his enemies (Christ is considered here, as he appeared in the form of a servant, in which respect he ruleth the Church as head, and that because this power was given him of his Father.) under his feet."},{"number":26,"verse":"The (The shutting up of the argument, which is taken from the whole to the part: for if all his enemies shall be put under his feet, then must it needs be that death also shall be subdued under him.) last enemy that shall be destroyed, is death."},{"number":27,"verse":"(Ps. 8:6; Heb. 2:8) For he hath put down all things under his feet. (And when he saith that all things are subdued to him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put down all things under him.)"},{"number":28,"verse":"And when all things shall be subdued unto him, (Not because the Son was not subject to his Father before, but because his body, that is to say, the Church which is here in distress, and not yet wholly partaker of his glory, is not yet fully perfect, and also because the bodies of the saints which be in the graves shall not be glorified until the resurrection: but Christ as he is God, hath us subject to him as his Father hath, but as he is Priest, he is subject to his father together with us. Augustine, book 1, chap. 8, of the Trinity.) then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him, that did subdue all things under him, that (By this high kind of speech, is set forth an incomprehensible glory which floweth from God, and shall fill all of us, as we are joined together with our head, but yet so, that our head shall always reserve his preeminence.) God may be all in all."},{"number":29,"verse":"(The fifth argument taken of the end of Baptism, to wit, because that they which are baptized, are baptized for dead, that is to say, that they may have a remedy against death because that Baptism is a token of regeneration.) Else what shall they do which are baptized (They that are baptized, to this end and purpose, that death may be put out in them, or to rise again from the dead, whereof baptism is a seal.) for dead? if the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for dead?"},{"number":30,"verse":"(The sixth argument: Unless there be a resurrection of the dead, why should the Apostles so daily cast themselves into danger of so many deaths?) Why are we also in jeopardy every hour?"},{"number":31,"verse":"By your (As though he said, I die daily, as all the miseries I suffer can well witness, which I may truly boast of, that I have suffered amongst you.) rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."},{"number":32,"verse":"(The taking away of an objection: but thou Paul, didst ambitiously, as commonly men are wont to do, when thou didst fight with beasts at Ephesus: That is very like, saith Paul, for what could that advantage me, were it not for the glory of eternal life which I hope for?) If I have fought with beasts at Ephesus (Not upon any godly motion, nor casting mine eyes upon God, but carried away with vain glory, or a certain headiness.) after the manner of men, what advantageth it me, if the dead be not raised up? let us (These are speeches that Epicureans use.) eat and drink: for tomorrow we shall die. (The seventh argument which dependeth upon the last: if there be no resurrection of the dead, why do we give ourselves to anything else, save to eating and drinking?) (Isa. 22:13)"},{"number":33,"verse":"(The conclusion with a sharp exhortation, that they take heed of the naughty company of certain: from whence he showeth that this mischief sprang: warning them to be wise with sobriety unto righteousness.) Be not deceived: evil speakings corrupt good manners."},{"number":34,"verse":"Awake to live righteously, and sin not: for some have not the knowledge of God, I speak this to your shame."},{"number":35,"verse":"(Now that he hath proved the resurrection, he discovereth their doltishness, in that they scoffingly demanded, how it could be that the dead should rise again, and if they did rise again, they asked mockingly, what manner of bodies they should have. Therefore he sendeth these fellows which seemed to themselves to be marvelous wise and witty, to be instructed of poor rude husbandmen.) But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body come they forth?"},{"number":36,"verse":"(Thou mightest have learned either of these, saith Paul, by daily experience: for seeds are sown, and rot, and yet notwithstanding so far it is off, that they perish, that contrarywise they grow up far more beautiful: and whereas they are sown naked and dry, they spring up green from death by the virtue of God: and doth it seem incredible to thee that our bodies should rise from corruption, and that endued with a far more excellent quality?) O fool, that which thou sowest, is not quickened, except it die."},{"number":37,"verse":"And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare corn as it falleth, of wheat, or of some other."},{"number":38,"verse":"(We see a diversity both in one and the selfsame thing which hath now one form and then another, and yet keepeth its own kind, as it is evident in a grain which is sown bare, but springeth up far after another sort: and also in divers kinds of one selfsame sort, as amongst beasts: and also among things of divers sorts, as the heavenly bodies and the earthly bodies: which also differ very much one from another. Therefore there is no cause why we should reject either the resurrection of the bodies, or changing of them into a better state, as a thing impossible, or strange.) But God giveth it a body at his pleasure, even to every seed his own body."},{"number":39,"verse":"All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and another of birds:"},{"number":40,"verse":"There are also heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies: but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another."},{"number":41,"verse":"There is another glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory."},{"number":42,"verse":"(He maketh three manner of qualities of the bodies being raised: Incorruption, to wit, because they shall be sound, and altogether of a nature that cannot be corrupt: Glory, because they shall be adorned with beauty and honor: Power, because they shall continue everlasting without meat, drink, and all other helps, without which this frail life cannot keep itself from corruption.) So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is (Is buried, and man is hid as seed in the ground.) sown in corruption, and is raised in incorruption."},{"number":43,"verse":"It is sown in (Void of honor, void of glory, and beauty.) dishonor, and is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness, and is raised in (Freed from the former weakness, whereas it is subject to such alteration and change, that it cannot maintain itself without meat and drink, and such otherlike helps.) power."},{"number":44,"verse":"(He showeth perfectly in one word, this change of the quality of the body by the resurrection, when he saith, that of a natural body, it shall become a spiritual body, which two qualities being clean different, the one from the other, he straightway expoundeth and setteth forth diligently.) It is sown a natural body, and is raised a spiritual body: there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."},{"number":45,"verse":"(That is called a natural body, which is quickened and maintained by a living soul only, such as Adam was, of whom all we are born naturally: and that is said to be a spiritual, which together with the soul is quickened with a far more excellent virtue: to wit, with the Spirit of God, which descendeth from Christ the second Adam unto us.) As it is also written, The (Adam is called the first man, because he is the root as it were from which we spring: and Christ is the latter man: because he is the beginning of all them that are spiritual, and in him we are all comprehended.) first man (Gen. 2:7) Adam was made a living soul: and the last Adam was made a (Christ is called a Spirit, by reason of that most excellent nature, that is to say, God who dwelleth in him bodily, as Adam is called a living soul, by reason of the soul which is the best part in him.) quickening spirit."},{"number":46,"verse":"(Secondly he willeth the order of this double state or quality to be observed, that the natural was first, Adam being created of the clay of the earth: and the spiritual followed and came upon it, to wit, when the Lord being sent from heaven, endued our flesh which was prepared and made fit for him, with the fulness of the Godhead.) Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual: but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual."},{"number":47,"verse":"The first man is of the earth, (Wallowing in dirt, and wholly given to an earthly nature.) earthly: the second man is the Lord from (The Lord is said to come down from heaven by that kind of speech, whereby that which is proper to one is touched of another.) heaven."},{"number":48,"verse":"(He applieth both the earthly naturalness of Adam (if I may so say) to our bodies, so long as they are naturally conversant on earth, to wit, in this life, and in the grave: and also the spirituality of Christ to the same our bodies, after that they are risen again: and he saith, that that goeth before and this shall follow.) As is the earthly, such are they that are earthly: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly."},{"number":49,"verse":"And as we have born the (Not a vain and false image, but such an one as had the truth with it indeed.) image of the earthly, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly."},{"number":50,"verse":"(The conclusion: We cannot be partakers of the glory of God, unless we put off all that gross and filthy nature of our bodies subject to corruption, that the same body may be adorned with incorruptible glory.)
