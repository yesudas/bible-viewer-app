I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with (Cross references: : 1 Cor. 1:17) excellency of words, or of wisdom, showing unto you the (The Gospel.) testimony of God."},{"number":2,"verse":"For I (I purposed not to profess any other knowledge, but the knowledge of Christ and him crucified.) esteemed not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."},{"number":3,"verse":"(Acts 18:1) And I was among you in (He setteth weakness, against excellency of words, and therefore joineth with it fear and trembling, which are the companions of true modesty, not such fear and trembling as terrify the conscience, but such as are contrary to vanity and pride.) weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."},{"number":4,"verse":"Neither stood my word, and my preaching in the (1 Cor. 1:17; 2 Pet. 1:16) enticing speech of man’s wisdom, (He turneth that now to the commendation of his ministry, which he had granted to his adversaries: for his virtue and power which they knew well enough, was so much the more excellent, because it had no worldly help joined with it.) but in plain (By plain evidence he meaneth such a proof, as is made by certain and necessary reasons.) evidence of the Spirit and of power."},{"number":5,"verse":"(And he telleth the Corinthians, that he did it for their great profit, because they might thereby know manifestly, that the Gospel was from heaven. Therefore he privately rebuketh them, because that in seeking vain ostentation, they willingly deprived themselves of the greatest help of their faith.) That your faith should not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."},{"number":6,"verse":"(Another argument taken of the nature of the thing, that is, of the Gospel, which is true wisdom, but known to them only which are desirous of perfection: and is unsavory to them which otherwise excel in the world, but yet vainly and frailly.) And we speak wisdom among them that are (Those are called perfect here, not which had gotten perfection already, but such as tend to it, as Phil. 3:15, so that perfect, is set against weak.) perfect: not the wisdom of this world, neither of the (They that are wiser, richer, or mightier than other men are.) princes of this world, which come to nought."},{"number":7,"verse":"(He showeth the cause why this wisdom cannot be perceived of those excellent worldly writes: to wit, because indeed it is so deep that they cannot attain unto it.) But we speak the wisdom of God in a (Which men could not so much as dream of.) mystery, even the hid wisdom, (He taketh away an objection: if it be so hard, when and how is it known? God, saith he, determined with himself from the beginning, that which his purpose was to bring forth at this time out of his secrets for the salvation of men.) which God had determined before the world, unto our glory."},{"number":8,"verse":"(He taketh away another objection: why then, how cometh it to pass, that this wisdom was so rejected of men of highest authority, that they crucified Christ himself? Paul answereth: because they knew not Christ such as he was.) Which none of the princes of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the (That mighty God, full of true majesty and glory: Now this place hath in it a most evident proof of the divinity of Christ, and of his joining of the two natures in one, which hath this in it, that that which is proper to the manhood alone, is vouched of the Godhead joined with the manhood: which kind of speech is called of the old fathers, a making common of things belonging to someone, with other to whom they do not belong.) Lord of glory."},{"number":9,"verse":"(Another objection: But how could it be that those witty men could not perceive this wisdom? Paul answereth: Because we preach those things which pass all man’s understanding.) But as it is written, (Isa. 64:4) The things which eye hath not seen, neither ear hath heard, neither came into (Man cannot so much as think of them, much less conceive them with his senses.) man’s heart, are, which God hath prepared for them that love him."},{"number":10,"verse":"(A question: if it surmount the capacity of men, how can it be understood of any man, or how can you declare and preach it? by a peculiar lightening by God’s Spirit, wherewith whosoever is inspired, he can enter even to the very secrets of God.) But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the spirit (There is nothing so secret and hidden in God, but the Spirit of God peereth into it.) searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."},{"number":11,"verse":"(He setteth that forth by a similitude, which he spake of the inspiration of the Spirit. As the force of man’s wit searcheth out things pertaining to man, so doth our mind by that power of the holy Ghost, understand heavenly things.) For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the (The mind of man, which is endued with ableness to understand and judge.) spirit of a man, which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God."},{"number":12,"verse":"Now we have receiveth not the (The Spirit which we have received, doth not teach us things of this world, but lifteth us up to God, and this place teacheth us against the Papists, what faith is, from whence it cometh, and what force it is of.) spirit of the world, but the Spirit, which is of God, (That which he spake generally, he restraineth now to those things which God hath opened unto us of our salvation in Christ: lest that any man should separate the Spirit from the preaching of the word and Christ: or should think that those fantastical men are governed by the Spirit of God, which wandering besides the word, thrust upon us their vain imaginations for the secrets of God.) that we might (This word (know) is taken here in his proper sense, for true knowledge, which the Spirit of God worketh in us.) know the things that are given to us of God."},{"number":13,"verse":"(Now he returneth to his purpose, and concludeth the argument which he began verse 6, and it is thus: the words must be applied to the matter, and the matter must be set forth with words which are meet and convenient for it: now this wisdom is spiritual and not of man, and therefore it must be delivered by a spiritual kind of teaching, and not by enticing words of man’s eloquence, that the simple, and yet wonderful majesty of the holy Ghost may therein appear.) Which things also we speak, not in the (1 Cor. 1:17; 2 Pet. 1:16) words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the holy Ghost teacheth, (Applying the words unto the matter, to wit, that as we teach spiritual things, so [must] our kind of teaching be spiritual.) comparing spiritual things with spiritual things."},{"number":14,"verse":"(Again he preventeth an offence or stumbling block: how cometh it to pass that so few allow these things? This is not to be marveled at, sayeth the Apostle, seeing that men in their natural powers (as they termed them) are not endued with that faculty, whereby spiritual things are discerned (which faculty cometh another way) and therefore they accompt spiritual wisdom as folly: and it is as if he should say, It is no marvel that blind men cannot judge of colors, seeing that they lack the light of their eyes, and therefore light is to them as darkness.) But the (The man that hath no further light of understanding than that which he brought with him, even from his mother’s womb, as Jude defineth it, Jude 19.) natural man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are (By the virtue of the holy Ghost.) spiritually discerned."},{"number":15,"verse":"(He amplifieth the matter by contraries.) But he that is spiritual, (Understandeth and discerneth.) discerneth all things: yet (The wisdom of the flesh, saith Paul, determined nothing certainly, no not in its own affairs, much less can it discern strange, that is, spiritual things. But the Spirit of God, wherewith spiritual men are endued, can be deceived by no means, and therefore be reproved of no man.) he himself is judged of (Of no man: for when the Prophets are judged of the Prophets, it is the Spirit that judges, and not the man.) no man."},{"number":16,"verse":"(Isa. 40:13; Rom. 11:34) (A reason of the former saying: for he is called spiritual, which hath learned that by the virtue of the Spirit, which Christ hath taught us. Now if that which we have learned of that Master, could be reproved of any man, he must needs be wiser than God: whereupon it followeth, that they are not only foolish, but also wicked, which think that they can devise something that is either more perfect, or that they can teach the wisdom of God a better way than they knew or taught, which undoubtedly, were endued with God’s Spirit.) For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he might (Lay his head to his, and teach him what he should do.) instruct him? But we have the (We are endued with the Spirit of Christ, who openeth unto us those secrets, which by all other means are unsearchable, and also all truth whatsoever.) mind of Christ."}]}
