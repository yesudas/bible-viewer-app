Am (Before he proceedeth any further in his proposed manner of things offered to idols he would show the cause of all this mischief, and also take it away: to wit, that the Corinthians thought themselves not bound to depart from an iota of their liberty for any man’s pleasure. Therefore he propoundeth himself for an example and that in a matter almost necessary. And yet he speaketh generally of both, but first of his own person. If (saith he) you allege for yourselves that you are free, and therefore will use your liberty, am I not also free, seeing I am an Apostle?) I not an Apostle? am I not free? (He proveth his Apostleship by the effects, in that that he was appointed of Christ himself, and the authority of his function was sufficiently confirmed to him amongst them by their conversion. And all these things he setteth before their eyes, to make them ashamed for that they would not in the least wise that might be, debase themselves, for the weak’s sake, whereas the Apostle himself did all that he could to win them to God when they were utterly reprobate and without God.) have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are ye not my work (By the Lord.) in the Lord?"},{"number":2,"verse":"If I be not an Apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am unto you: for ye are the (As a seal whereby it appeareth sufficiently that God is the author of my Apostleship.) seal of mine Apostleship in the Lord."},{"number":3,"verse":"(He addeth this by the way, as if he would say, So far it is off, that you may doubt of my Apostleship, that I use it to refute them which call it into controversy, by opposing those things which the Lord hath done by me amongst you.) My defense to him that (Which like Judges examine me and my doings.) examine me, is this,"},{"number":4,"verse":"(Now touching the matter itself, he saith, Seeing that I am free, and truly an Apostle, why may not I (I say not, eat of all things offered to idols) but be maintained by my labors, yea and keep my wife also, as the residue of the apostles lawfully do, as by name, John and James, the Lord’s cousins, and Peter himself?) Have we not power to (Upon the expense of the Church?) eat and to drink?"},{"number":5,"verse":"Or have we not power to lead about a wife being a (One that is a Christian and a true believer?) sister, as well as the rest of the Apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?"},{"number":6,"verse":"Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power (Not to live by the work of our hands?) not to work?"},{"number":7,"verse":"(That he may not seem to burden the Apostles, he showeth that it is just that they do, by an argument of comparison, seeing that soldiers live by their wages, and husbandmen by the fruits of their labors, and shepherds by that that cometh of their flocks.) Who (Useth to go a warfare?) goeth a warfare any time at his own cost? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"},{"number":8,"verse":"(Secondly he bringeth forth the authority of God’s institution by an argument of comparison.) Say I these things (Have I no better ground than the common custom of men?) according to man? saith not the Law the same also?"},{"number":9,"verse":"For it is written in the Law of Moses, (Cross references: : Deut. 25:4; 1 Tim. 5:18) Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn: doth God take care for (Was it God’s proper drift to provide for oxen, when he made this Law? for otherwise there is not the smallest thing in the world, but God hath a care of it.) oxen?"},{"number":10,"verse":"Either saith he it not altogether for our sakes?

If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things?"},{"number":12,"verse":"(Another argument of great force: others are nourished amongst you, therefore it was lawful for me, yea rather for me than any other: and yet I refused it, and had rather still suffer any discommodity, than the Gospel of Christ should be hindered.) If others with you be partakers of this (The word signifieth a right and interest, whereby he giveth us to understand that the ministers of the word must of right and duty be found of the Church.) power, are not we rather? nevertheless, we have not used this power: but suffer all things, that we should not hinder the Gospel of Christ."},{"number":13,"verse":"(Last of all he bringeth forth the express Law concerning the nourishing of the Levites, which privilege notwithstanding he will not use.) Do ye not know, that they which minister about the (Deut. 18:1) holy things, eat of the (This is spoken by the figure Metonymy, for, of those things that are offered in the temple.) things of the Temple? and they which wait at the altar, are (Are partakers with the altar in dividing the sacrifice.) partakers with the altar?"},{"number":14,"verse":"So also hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospel, should live (Because they preach the Gospel.

Nay saith him, I had rather die, than not continue in this purpose to preach the Gospel freely. For I am bound to preach the Gospel, seeing that the Lord hath enjoined me this office: but unless I do it willingly and for the love of God, nothing is to be allowed that I do. If I had rather that the Gospel should be evil spoken of, than that I should not require my wages, then would it appear that I took these pains not so much for the Gospel’s sake, as for my gains and advantages. But I say, this were not to use, but abuse my right and liberty. Therefore not only in this thing, but also in all others (as much as I could) I am made all things to all men, that I might win them to Christ, and might together with them be won to Christ.) neither wrote I these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my rejoicing vain."},{"number":16,"verse":"For though I preach the Gospel, I have nothing to rejoice of: for necessity is laid upon me, and woe is unto me, if I preach not the Gospel."},{"number":17,"verse":"For if I do it willingly, I have a reward, but if I do it against my will, notwithstanding the dispensation is committed unto me."},{"number":18,"verse":"What is my reward then? verily that when I preach the Gospel, I make the Gospel of Christ (By taking nothing of them to whom I preach it.) free, that I abuse not mine authority in the Gospel."},{"number":19,"verse":"For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all men, that I may win the more."},{"number":20,"verse":"(Acts 16:3; Gal. 2:3) And unto the Jews, I become as a Jew, that I may win the Jews: to them that are under the (The word (Law) in this place, must be restrained to the ceremonial Law.)

Therefore it was hard for them which were accustomed to righteousness, especially when they pretended the liberty of the Gospel, to be restrained from these banquets: but contrarywise, the Apostle calleth them by a pleasant similitude, and also by his own example, to sobriety and mortification of the flesh, showing that they cannot be fit to run or wrestle (as then the games of Isthmians were) which pamper up their bodies, and therefore affirming that they can have no reward, unless they take another course and trade of life.)
