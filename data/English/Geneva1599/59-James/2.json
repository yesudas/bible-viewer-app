Hearken my beloved brethren, hath not God chosen the (The needy and wretched, and (if we measure it after the opinion of the world) the veriest abjects of all men.) poor of this world, that they should be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?"},{"number":6,"verse":"But ye have despised the poor. (Secondly, he proveth them to be mad men: for that the rich men are rather to be holden execrable and cursed, considering that they persecute the Church, and blaspheme Christ: for he speaketh of wicked and profane rich men, such as the most part of them have been always, against whom he setteth the poor and abject.) Do not the rich oppress you by tyranny, and do they not draw you before the judgment seats?"},{"number":7,"verse":"Do not they blaspheme the worthy Name after which ye be (Word for word, which is called upon of you.) named?"},{"number":8,"verse":"(The conclusion: Charity which God prescribeth cannot agree with the accepting of persons, seeing that we must walk in the King’s highway.) But if ye fulfill the (The Law is said to be royal and like the King’s highway, for that it is plain and without turnings, and that the Law calleth everyone our neighbor, without respect, whom we may help by any kind of duty.) royal Law according to the Scripture, which saith, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well."},{"number":9,"verse":"But if ye regard the persons, ye commit sin, and are rebuked of the Law, as transgressors."},{"number":10,"verse":"(A new argument to prove the same conclusion: They do not love their neighbors, which neglect some, and ambitiously honor others: for he doth not obey God, which cutteth off from the commandments of God that that is not so commodious for him, nay he is rather guilty generally for the breach of the whole Law, although he observe the residue.) For whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet faileth in one point, he is guilty of (Not that all sins are equal, but because he that breaketh one tittle of the Law, offendeth the majesty of the Lawgiver.) all."},{"number":11,"verse":"(A proof: because the Lawmaker is always one and the selfsame, and the body of the Law cannot be divided.) For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now though thou doest none adultery, yet if thou killest, thou art a transgressor of the Law."},{"number":12,"verse":"(The conclusion of the whole treatise: we are upon this condition delivered from the curse of the Law by the mercy of God, that in like sort we should maintain and cherish charity and goodwill one towards another, and whoso doth not so, shall not taste of the grace of God.) So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judgeth by the Law of liberty."},{"number":13,"verse":"For there shall be condemnation merciless to him that showeth not (He that is hard and currish against his neighbor, or else helpeth him not, he shall find God an hard and rough Judge to himselfward.) mercy, and mercy rejoiceth against condemnation."},{"number":14,"verse":"(The fifth place which hangeth very well with the former treatise, touching a true and lively faith. And the proposition of this place is this: faith which bringeth not forth works, is not that faith whereby we are justified, but an image of faith: or else this, they are not justified by faith, which show not the effects of faith.) What availeth it my brethren, though a man saith, he hath faith, when he hath no works? can that faith save him?"},{"number":15,"verse":"(The first reason taken of a similitude: If a man say to one that is hungry, Fill thy belly, and yet giveth him nothing, this shall not be true charity: so if a man say he believeth, and bringeth forth no works of his faith, this shall not be a true faith, but a certain dead thing set out with the name of faith, whereof no man hath to brag, unless he will openly incur reprehension, seeing that the cause is understood by the effects.) For if a brother or a sister be naked and destitute of daily food,"},{"number":16,"verse":"And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace: warm yourselves, and fill your bellies, notwithstanding ye give them not those things, which are needful to the body, what helpeth it?"},{"number":17,"verse":"Even so the faith, if it have no works, is dead in itself."},{"number":18,"verse":"But (Nay, thus may every man beat down the pride.) some man might say, Thou hast the faith, and I have works: show me thy faith out of thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works."},{"number":19,"verse":"(Another reason taken of an absurdity: If such a faith were the true faith whereby we are justified, the devils should be justified: for they have that, but yet notwithstanding they tremble, and are not justified therefore, neither is that faith a true faith.) Thou believest that there is one God: thou doest well: the devils also believe it, and tremble."},{"number":20,"verse":"(The third reason from the example of Abraham, who no doubt had a true faith: but he in offering his son, showed himself to have that faith which was not void of works, and therefore he received a true testimony when it was said, that faith was imputed to him for righteousness.) But wilt thou understand, O thou vain man, that the faith which is without works, is dead?"},{"number":21,"verse":"Was not Abraham our father (Was he not by his works known and found to be justified? for he speaketh not here of the causes of justification, but by what effects we may know that a man is justified.) justified through works, (Gen. 22:10) when he offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"},{"number":22,"verse":"Seest thou not that the faith (Was effectual and fruitful with good works.) wrought with his works? and through the works was the faith made (That the faith was declared to be a true faith, and that by works.) perfect."},{"number":23,"verse":"And the Scripture was (Then was the Scripture fulfilled, when it appeared plainly, how truly it was written of Abraham.) fulfilled which saith, (Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3; Gal. 3:6) Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the friend of God."},{"number":24,"verse":"(The conclusion: he is only justified that hath that faith which hath works following it.) Ye see then how that of works a man is (Is proved to be just.) justified, and not of (Of that dead and fruitless faith which you boast of.) faith only."},{"number":25,"verse":"(A fourth reason taken from a like example of Rahab the harlot, who also proved by her works that she was justified by a true faith.) Likewise also was not (Josh. 2:1) Rahab the harlot justified through works, when she had received the messengers, and sent them out another way?"},{"number":26,"verse":"(The conclusion repeated again: faith which bringeth not forth fruits and works, is not faith, but a dead carcass.) For as the body without the spirit is dead, even so the faith without works is dead."}]}
