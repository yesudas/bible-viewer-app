Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the amity of the world is the enmity of God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world, maketh himself the enemy of God."},{"number":5,"verse":"(The taking away of an objection: Indeed our minds run headlong into these vices, but we ought so much the more diligently take heed of them: which care and study shall not be in vain, seeing that God resists the stubborn, and giveth that grace to the modest and humble that surmounteth all those vices.) Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us, lusteth after envy?"},{"number":6,"verse":"But the Scripture offereth more grace, and therefore saith, (Cross references: : Prov. 3:34; 1 Pet. 5:5) God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble."},{"number":7,"verse":"(Eph. 4:27) (The conclusion: We must set the contrary virtues against those vices, and therefore whereas we obeyed the suggestions of the devil, we must submit our minds to God, and resist the devil, with a certain and assured hope of victory: To be short, we must employ ourselves to come near unto God by purity and sincerity of life.) Submit yourselves to God: resist the devil, and he will flee from you."},{"number":8,"verse":"Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purge your hearts, ye double minded."},{"number":9,"verse":"(He goeth on in the same comparison of contraries, and setteth against those profane joys with an earnest sorrow of mind, and against pride and arrogance, holy modesty.) Suffer afflictions, and sorrow ye, and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into (By this word the Greeks meant an heaviness joined with shamefastness, which is to be seen in a cast down countenance, and settled as it were upon the ground.) heaviness."},{"number":10,"verse":"(1 Pet. 5:6) Cast down yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up."},{"number":11,"verse":"(He reprehended most sharply another double mischief of pride: the one is in that the proud and arrogant will have other men to live according to their will and pleasure and therefore they do most arrogantly condemn whatsoever pleaseth them not: which thing cannot be done without great injury to our only Lawmaker, for by this means his Laws are found fault withal, as not circumspectly enough written, and men challenge that unto themselves which properly belongeth to God alone, in that they lay a Law upon menâ€™s consciences.) Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, or he that condemneth his brother, speaketh evil of the Law, and condemneth the Law: and if thou condemnest the Law, thou art not an observer of the Law, but a judge."},{"number":12,"verse":"There is one Lawgiver, which is able to save, and to destroy, (Rom. 14:4) Who art thou that judgest another man?"},{"number":13,"verse":"(The other fault is this: that men do so confidently determine upon these and those matters and businesses, as though that every moment of their life did not depend of God.) Go to now, ye that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain,"},{"number":14,"verse":"(And yet ye cannot tell what shall be tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and afterward vanisheth away.)"},{"number":15,"verse":"For that ye ought to say, (1 Cor. 4:19) If the Lord will, and if we live, we will do this or that."},{"number":16,"verse":"But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil."},{"number":17,"verse":"(The conclusion of all the former treatise: The knowledge of the will of God doth not only nothing at all profit, unless the life be answerable unto it, but also maketh the sins far more grievous.) Therefore to him that knoweth how to do well, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."}]}
