My brethren, (Seeing their condition was miserable in that scattering abroad, he doth well to begin as he doth.) count it exceeding joy, (The first argument, because our faith is tried through afflictions: which ought to be most pure, for so it is behoovable for us.) when ye fall into divers tentations,"},{"number":3,"verse":"(Cross references: : Rom. 5:3) (The second, Because patience, far passing and most excellent virtue, is by this means engendered in us.) Knowing that the (That wherewith your faith is tried, to wit, those manifold temptations.) trying of your faith bringeth forth patience,"},{"number":4,"verse":"(The third argument propounded in manner of an exhortation, that true and continual patience may be discerned from fained and for a time. The cross is as it were the instrument wherewith God doth polish and [re]fine us. Therefore the work and effect of afflictions, is the perfecting of us in Christ.) And let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing."},{"number":5,"verse":"(An answer to a privy objection: It is easily said, but it is not so easily done. He answereth that we need in this case a far other manner of wisdom, than the wisdom of man, to judge those things best for us, which are most contrary to the flesh: but yet we shall easily obtain this gift of wisdom, if we ask it rightly, that is, with a sure confidence of God, who is most bountiful and liberal.) If any of you lack (By wisdom he meaneth the knowledge of that doctrine whereof mention was made before, to wit, wherefore we are afflicted of God, and what fruit we have to reap of affliction.) wisdom, let him ask of God, which giveth to all men liberally, and reproacheth no man, and it shall be given him."},{"number":6,"verse":"(Matt. 7:7; Mark 11:24; Luke 11:9; John 14:13; John 16:23) But let him ask in faith, and (Why then what need other Mediator?) waver not: (A digression or going aside from his matter, against prayers which are conceived with a doubting mind, whereas we have a certain promise of God, and this is that second part of the Epistle.) for he that wavereth, is like a wave of the sea, tossed of the wind, and carried away."},{"number":7,"verse":"Neither let that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord."},{"number":8,"verse":"A double minded man is unstable in (In all his thoughts and his deeds.) all his ways."},{"number":9,"verse":"(He returneth to his purpose, repeating the proposition, which is, that we must rejoice in the cross, for it doth not press us down, but exalt us.)

Again, he that is (Who hath all things at his will.) rich, in that he is made low: (An argument taken of the very nature of the things themselves, for that they are most vain and uncertain.) for as the flower of the grass, shall he (Isa. 40:6; 1 Pet. 2:24) vanish away."},{"number":11,"verse":"For as when the sun riseth with heat, then the grass withereth, and his flower falleth away, and the goodly shape of it perisheth: even so shall the rich man wither away in all his (Whatsoever he either purposeth in his mind, or doeth.) ways."},{"number":12,"verse":"Blessed is the man, that endureth (Affliction whereby the Lord trieth him.) tentation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.

Let no man say when he is (When he is provoked to do evil.) tempted, I am tempted of God: (Here is a reason showed, why God cannot be the author of evil doing in us, because he desireth not evil.) for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man."},{"number":14,"verse":"But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own concupiscence, and is enticed."},{"number":15,"verse":"Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth (By sin is meant in this place actual sin.) sin, and sin when it is finished, bringeth forth death."},{"number":16,"verse":"(Another reason taken of contraries: God is the author of all goodness, and so, that he is always like himself; how then can he be thought to be author of evil?)

The sum is this: we must hear the word of God most carefully and diligently, seeing it is the seed, wherewith God of his free favor and love hath begotten us unto himself, picking us out of the number of his creatures. And the Apostle condemneth two faults, which do greatly trouble us in this matter, to wit, for that we so please ourselves, that we had rather speak ourselves than hear God speaking: yea, we snuff and are angry when we are reprehended: against which faults, he setteth a peaceable and quiet mind, and such an one as is desirous of purity.) Of his own (This is it which Paul calleth gracious favor, and good will, which is the fountain of our salvation.) will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be as the (As it were an holy kind of offering, taken out of the residue of man.) firstfruits of his creatures."},{"number":19,"verse":"Wherefore my dear brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath."},{"number":20,"verse":"For the wrath of man doth not accomplish the (That which God appointeth.) righteousness of God."},{"number":21,"verse":"Wherefore lay apart all filthiness, and superfluity of maliciousness, and receive with (By meekness, he meaneth modesty, and whatsoever is contrary to an haughty and proud stomach.) meekness the word that is grafted in you, which is able to save your souls."},{"number":22,"verse":"(Matt. 7:21; Rom. 2:13) (Another admonition.

If any man among you seem religious, and refraineth not his tongue, but deceiveth his (The fountain of all brabbling, and cursed speaking, and sauciness, is this, that men know not themselves.) own heart, this man’s religion is vain."},{"number":27,"verse":"(The fourth: the true service of God standeth in charity toward our neighbors (especially such as need others’ help, as the fatherless and widows), and purity of life.)
