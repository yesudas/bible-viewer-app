Wherefore, laying aside all maliciousness, and all guile, and dissimulation, and envy, and all evil speaking,"},{"number":2,"verse":"(The second is, that being newly begotten and born of the new seed of the incorrupt word drawing and sucking greedily the same word as milk, we should more and more as it were grow up in that spiritual life. And he calleth it, Sincere, not only because it is a most pure thing, but also that we should take heed of them which corrupt it.) As (As becometh new men.) newborn babes desire that sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby,"},{"number":3,"verse":"(He commendeth that spiritual nourishment for the sweetness and profit of it.)

Therefore he saith, that the company of the faithful is as it were a certain holy and spiritual building, built of lively stones, the foundation whereof is Christ, as a lively stone sustaining all that are joined unto him with his living virtue, and knitting them together with himself, although this so great a treasure be neglected of men.)

Therefore he answereth first of all that there is no cause why any man should be astonished at this their stubbornness, as though it were a strange matter, seeing that we have been forewarned so long before, that it should so come to pass: and moreover, that it pleased God to create and make certain to this selfsame purpose, that the Son of God might be glorified in their just condemnation. Thirdly, for that the glory of Christ is hereby set forth greatly, whereas notwithstanding Christ remaineth the sure head of his Church, and they that stumble at him, cast down and overthrow themselves, and not Christ. Fourthly, although they be created to this end and purpose, yet their fall and decay is not to be attributeth to God, but to their own obstinate stubbornness which cometh between God’s decree, and the execution thereof or their condemnation, and is the true and proper cause of their destruction.) Unto you therefore which believe, it is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the (Ps. 118:21; Matt. 21:41; Acts 4:11) stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,"},{"number":8,"verse":"And a (Isa. 8:14; Rom. 9:33) stone to stumble at, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient, unto the which thing they were even ordained."},{"number":9,"verse":"(The contrary member, to wit, he describeth the singular excellency of the elect: and also lest any man should doubt whether he be chosen or not, the Apostle calleth us back to the effectual calling, that is, to the voice of the Gospel sounding both in our ears and minds by the outward preaching and Sacraments, whereby we may certainly understand that everlasting decree of our salvation, (which otherwise is most secret and hidden) and that through the only mercy of God, who freely chooseth and calleth us. Therefore this only remaineth, sayeth he, that by all means possible we set forth so great goodness of the most mighty God.) But ye are a chosen generation, a royal (Exod. 19:6) Priesthood, an holy nation, a people set at liberty, that ye should show forth the virtues of him that hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light,"},{"number":10,"verse":"(Hos. 2:23; Rom. 9:25) Which in time past were not a people, yet are now the people of God: which in time past were not under mercy, but now have obtained mercy."},{"number":11,"verse":"(He returneth to that general exhortation.) Dearly beloved, (A reason why we ought to live holily, to wit, because we are citizens of heaven, and therefore we ought to live according to the Laws not of this world, which is most corrupt, but of the heavenly city, although we be strangers in the world.) I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts (The third argument: for although those lusts flatter us, yet they cease not to fight against our salvation.) which fight against the soul, (Another argument: The children of God live not according to the flesh, that is, according to that corrupt nature, but according to the spirit.
