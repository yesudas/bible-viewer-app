For it is sufficient for us that we have spent the time past of the life, after the lust (Wickedly and licentiously after the manner of the Gentiles.) of the Gentiles walking in wantonness, lusts, drunkenness, in gluttony, drinkings, and in abominable idolatries."},{"number":4,"verse":"(That we be not moved with the enemies’ perverse and slanderous judgments of us, we have to set against them that last judgment of God which remaineth for them, for none, whether they be then found living, or were dead before, shall escape it.) Wherein it seemeth to them (They think it a new and strange matter.) strange, that ye run not with them unto the same excess of riot: therefore speak they evil of you."},{"number":5,"verse":"Which shall give account to him, that is ready to judge quick and dead."},{"number":6,"verse":"(A digression because he made mention of the last general judgement. And he preventeth an objection, that seeing Christ came very lately, they may seem to be excusable which died before. But this the Apostle denieth, for (saith he) this selfsame Gospel was preached unto them also: (for he speaketh unto the Jews) and that to the same end that I now preach it unto you, to wit, that the flesh being abolished and put away (that is to say, that wicked and naughty corruption which reigneth in men) they should suffer themselves to be governed by the virtue of the Spirit of God.) For unto this purpose was the Gospel preached also unto the dead, that they might be condemned according to men in the flesh, but might live according to God in the spirit."},{"number":7,"verse":"(He returneth to his purpose, using an argument taken from the circumstance of the time, because the last end is at hand, and therefore we must so much the more diligently watch and pray with true sobriety of mind.) Now the end of all things is at hand. Be ye therefore sober, and watching in prayer."},{"number":8,"verse":"(He commendeth charity of one toward another, because it doth as it were bury a multitude of sins, and therefore preserveth and maintaineth peace and concord: for they that love one another, do easily forgive one another their offense.) But above all things have fervent love among you: (Prov. 10:12) for love shall cover the multitude of sins."},{"number":9,"verse":"(Of all the duties of charity, he commendeth one, namely, which was at that time most necessary, to wit, hospitality, which he will have to be voluntary and most courteous and bountiful.) Be ye (Rom. 12:13; Heb. 13:2) harberous one to another, without grudging."},{"number":10,"verse":"Let every man as he hath received the gift, minister the same one to another, (A reason, because that what gift soever we have we have received it of God upon this condition, to be his disposers and stewards.) as good disposers of the manifold grace of God. (He showeth the use of charity, to wit, that every man bestow that gift which he hath received to the profit of his neighbor.) (Rom. 12:6; Phil 2:14)"},{"number":11,"verse":"(He reckoneth up two kinds of these gifts as chief, to wit, the office of teaching in the Church, and the other Ecclesiastical functions, wherein two things specially are to be observed, to wit, that the pure word of God be taught, and whatsoever is done, be referred to the glory of God the Father, in Christ, as to the proper mark.) If any man speak, let him speak as the words of God. If any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God ministereth, that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is praise and dominion forever, and ever, Amen."},{"number":12,"verse":"(Because the cross is joined with the sincere profession of Religion, the Apostle fitly repeateth that which he touched before, warning us not to be troubled at persecutions and afflictions, as a new and strange thing.) Dearly beloved, think it not (As though some new thing had befallen you, which you never thought of before.) strange (The first reason: Because the Lord meaneth not to consume us with this fire (as it were) but to purge us of our dross, and make us perfect.) concerning the fiery trial, which is among you to prove you as though some strange thing were come unto you."},{"number":13,"verse":"(Another reason: Because the afflictions of the godly and the wicked differ very much, and chiefly in three points. First, because the godly communicate with Christ in their afflictions, and therefore shall in their time be partakers also of his glory.) But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, that when his glory shall appear, ye may be glad and rejoice."},{"number":14,"verse":"(Matt. 10) (Secondly, because that although the infidels think far otherwise, who in afflicting the godly, blaspheme God, yet the godly in that they are so railed upon, are honored of God with the true spiritual glory, and their adoption sealed in them by the Spirit of God.) If ye be railed upon for the Name of Christ, blessed are ye: for the (By Spirit he meaneth the gifts of the Spirit.) spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: which on their part is evil spoken of, but on your part is glorified."},{"number":15,"verse":"(The third difference: for the godly are not afflicted for their evil doings, but for righteousness’ sake as Christians: whereby it cometh to pass that the cross, seeing it is a testimony unto them of faith and righteousness, ministereth unto them not an occasion of sorrow, but of unspeakable joy: now the Apostle propoundeth the third difference under the form of an exhortation.) But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or an evil doer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters."},{"number":16,"verse":"But if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed: but let him glorify God in this behalf."},{"number":17,"verse":"(The third reason because the Lord of all the world being especially careful for them of his household, doth therefore chastise them first of all, yet so that he keepeth a measure in his greatest severity: And as he hath always used to do heretofore, so doth he now specially when as he exhibited himself in person to his Church.) For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God. (Lest the godly should be offended and stumble at that vain shadow of felicity of the wicked, as though God were not the governor of the world, for that the wicked are in good case, and the godly in evil, the Apostle teacheth by an argument of a comparison of them together, that God who spareth not his own, but nurtureth them under the cross, will at length in his time handle the rebellious and wicked far otherwise, whom he hath appointed to utter destruction.) If it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them which obey not the Gospel of God?"},{"number":18,"verse":"(Prov. 2:31) And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"},{"number":19,"verse":"(The conclusion: Seeing the godly are not afflicted by chance, but by the will of God, they ought not to despair, but go forward, notwithstanding in the way of holiness and well doing, commending themselves to God their faithful Creator, that is to say, their Father.) Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator."}]}
