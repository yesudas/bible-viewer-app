Holiest of all,"},{"number":4,"verse":"Which had the golden censer, and the Ark of the Testament overlaid round about with gold, wherein the golden pot, which had Manna, was, and (Cross references: : Num. 7:10) Aaron’s rod that had budded, and the (1 Kings 8:9; 2 Chron. 5:10) tables of the Testament."},{"number":5,"verse":"(Exod. 21:22) And over the Ark were the glorious Cherubims, shadowing the (The Hebrews call the cover of the Ark of the covenant, the mercy seat, whom both the Greeks and we follow.) mercy seat: of which things we will not now speak particularly."},{"number":6,"verse":"(Now he cometh to the sacrifices which he divideth into those daily sacrifices, and that yearly and solemn sacrifice, with the which the high Priest only, but once every year entering into the Holiest of all with blood, offered for himself and the people.)

For why did the high Priest alone enter in thither, shutting out all other, and that to offer sacrifices there both for himself and for others, and after did shut the Holiest of all again?) Whereby the holy Ghost this signified, that the way into the Holiest of all was not yet opened, while as yet the first tabernacle was standing,"},{"number":9,"verse":"(An objection: If the way were not opened into heaven by those sacrifices (that is to say, If the worshippers were not purged by them) why then were those ceremonies used? to wit, that men might be called back to that spiritual example, that is to say, to Christ, who should correct all those things at his coming.) Which was a figure (For that time that that figure had to last.) for that present time, wherein were offered gifts and sacrifices that could not make holy, concerning the conscience, him that did the service,"},{"number":10,"verse":"(Another reason why they could not make clean the conscience of the worshipper, to wit, because they were outward and carnal or corporal things.)

But Christ being come an high Priest of good things to come, (Another comparison of the first corruptible Tabernacle with the latter (that is to say, with the human nature of Christ) which is the true incorruptible Temple of God, whereinto which the Son of GOD entered, as the Levitical high Priests into the other which was frail and transitory.) by a (By a more excellent and better.) greater and a more perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this building,"},{"number":12,"verse":"(Another comparison of the blood of sacrifices with Christ. The Levitical high Priests entering by their holy places into the Sanctuary, offered corruptible blood for one year only: but Christ entering into that holy body of his, entered by it into heaven itself, offering his own most pure blood for an everlasting redemption: For one selfsame Christ answereth both to the high Priest, and the Tabernacle, and the sacrifices, and offering themselves, as the truth to the figures, so that Christ is both the high Priest, and Tabernacle, and Sacrifice, yea, all these both truly, and forever.) Neither by the blood of (For in this yearly sacrifice of reconciliation, there were two kinds of sacrifices, the one a goat, the other a heifer, or calf.) goats and calves: but by his own blood entered he in once unto the holy place, and obtained eternal redemption for us."},{"number":13,"verse":"(Lev. 16:14; Num. 19:4) (If the outward sprinkling of blood and ashes of beasts, was a true and effectual sign of purifying and cleansing, how much more shall the thing itself and the truth being present, which in times past was shadowed by those external Sacraments, that is to say, his blood which is in such sort man’s blood, that is also the blood of the Son of God, and therefore hath an everlasting virtue of purifying and cleansing, does it?) For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer, sprinkling them that are unclean, sanctifieth as touching the (He considereth the signs apart, being separate from the thing itself.) purifying of the flesh,"},{"number":14,"verse":"How much more shall the (1 Pet. 1:19; 1 John 1:7; Rev. 1:5) blood of Christ which through the eternal Spirit offered himself without fault to God, (Luke 1:74) purge your conscience from (From sins which proceed from death, and bring forth nothing but death.) dead works, to serve the living God?"},{"number":15,"verse":"(The conclusion of the former argument: therefore seeing the blood of beasts did not purge sins, the new Testament which was before time promised, whereunto those outward things had respect, is now indeed established, by the virtue whereof all transgressions might be taken away, and heaven indeed opened unto us: whereof it followeth that Christ shed his blood also for the Fathers: For he was shadowed by those old ceremonies, otherwise, unless they had served to represent him, they had been nothing at all profitable. Therefore this Testament is called the latter, not concerning the virtue of it, (that is to say, remission of sins) but in respect of that time, wherein the thing itself was finished, that is to say, wherein Christ was indeed exhibited to the world, and fulfilled all things which were necessary to our salvation.) And for this cause is he the Mediator of the new Testament, that through (Rom. 5:6; 1 Pet. 3:18) death which was for the redemption of the transgressions that were in the former Testament, they which were called, might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."},{"number":16,"verse":"(A reason why the Testament must be established by the death of the Mediator, because this Testament hath the condition of a Testament or gift, which is made effectual by death, and therefore that it might be effectual, it must needs be that he that made the Testament, should die.) For where a Testament is, there must be the death of him that made the Testament."},{"number":17,"verse":"(Gal. 3:15) For the Testament is confirmed when men are dead: for it is yet of no force as long as he that made it, is alive."},{"number":18,"verse":"(There must be a proportion between those things which purify, and those which are purified: Under the Law all those figures were earthly, the Tabernacle, the book, the vessels, the sacrifices, although they were the figures of heavenly things. Therefore it was requisite that all those should be purified with some matter and ceremony of the same nature, to wit, with the blood of beasts, with water, wool, hyssop. But under Christ all things are heavenly, an heavenly tabernacle, an heavenly sacrifice, an heavenly people, an heavenly doctrine, and heaven itself is set open before us for an eternal habitation. Therefore all these things are sanctified in like sort, to wit, with the everlasting offering of the quickening blood of Christ.) Wherefore, neither was the first ordained without blood."},{"number":19,"verse":"For when Moses had spoken every precept to the people, (As the Lord had commanded.) according to the Law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water and purple wool and hyssop, and (He useth to sprinkle.) sprinkled both the book, and all the people,"},{"number":20,"verse":"(Exod. 24:8) Saying, This is the blood of the Testament, which God hath appointed unto you."},{"number":21,"verse":"Moreover, he sprinkled likewise the Tabernacle with blood also, and all the ministering vessels,"},{"number":22,"verse":"And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood is no remission."},{"number":23,"verse":"It was then necessary, that the (The similitudes of heavenly things were earthly, and therefore they were to be set forth with earthly things, as with the blood of beasts, and wool, and hyssop.

For Christ is not entered into the holy places that are made with hands, which are similitudes of the true Sanctuary: but is entered into very heaven, to appear now in the sight of God for us,"},{"number":25,"verse":"(Another double comparison: the Levitical high Priest offered other blood, but Christ offered his own: he every year once iterated his offering: Christ offering himself but once, abolished sin altogether, both of the former ages and of the ages to come.)
