Now (He briefly repeateth that, whereunto all these things are to be referred, to wit, we have a far other high Priest than those Levitical high Priests are, even such an one as sitteth at the right hand of the most high God in heaven.) of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum, that we have such an high Priest, that sitteth at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heavens,"},{"number":2,"verse":"(They of Levi were high Priests in an earthly sanctuary, but Christ is in the heavenly.) And is a minister of the (Of heaven.) Sanctuary, (They of Levi exercised their Priesthood in a frail tabernacle, but Christ beareth about with him a far other tabernacle, to wit, his body which God himself made to be everlasting, as it shall afterward be declared, Heb. 9:11.) and of that (Of his body.) true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched, and not man."},{"number":3,"verse":"(He bringeth a reason why it must needs be that Christ should have a body (which he calleth a tabernacle which the Lord pight and not man) to wit, that he might have what to offer: for otherwise he could not be an high Priest. And the selfsame body is both the tabernacle and the sacrifice.) For every high Priest is ordained to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it was of necessity, that this man should have somewhat also to offer."},{"number":4,"verse":"(He giveth a reason why he said that our high Priest is in the heavenly sanctuary and not in the earthly: because, saith he, if he were now on the earth, he could not minister in the earthly sanctuary, seeing there are yet Levitical Priests, which are appointed for him, that is to say, to be patterns of that perfect example. And to what purpose should the patterns serve when the true and original example is present.) For he were not a Priest, if he were on the earth, seeing there are Priests that according to the Law offer gifts,"},{"number":5,"verse":"Who serve unto the pattern and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was warned by God when he was about to finish the Tabernacle. (Cross references: : Exod. 15:40; Acts 7:44) See, said he, that thou make all things according to the pattern, showed to thee in the mount."},{"number":6,"verse":"(He entereth into the comparison of the old and transitory Testament or covenant being but for a time, whereof the Levitical Priests were mediators with the new the everlasting Mediator whereof is Christ, to show that this is not only better than that in all respects, but also that that was abrogated by this.) But now our high Priest hath obtained a more excellent office, inasmuch as he is the Mediator of a better Testament, which is established upon better promises."},{"number":7,"verse":"(He proveth by the testimony of Jeremiah, that there is a second Testament or covenant, and therefore that the first was not perfect.) For if that first Testament had been unblameable, no place should have been sought for the second."},{"number":8,"verse":"For in rebuking them he saith, (Jer. 31:31-34; Rom. 11:17; Heb. 10:16) Behold, the days will come, saith the Lord, when I shall make with the (He calleth it an house, as it were one family of the whole kingdom: for whereas the kingdom of David was divided into two factions, the Prophet giveth us to understand that through the new Testament they shall be joined together again in one.) house of Israel, and with the house of Judah a new Testament:"},{"number":9,"verse":"Not like the Testament that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt: for they continued not in my Testament, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord."},{"number":10,"verse":"For this is the Testament that I will make with the house of Israel, After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my Laws in their mind, and in their heart I will write them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."},{"number":11,"verse":"And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them."},{"number":12,"verse":"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more."},{"number":13,"verse":"(The conclusion: Therefore by the latter and the new, the first and old is taken away, for it could not be called new if it differed not from the old. And again that same is at length taken away: which is subject to corruption, and therefore imperfect.) In that he saith a new Testament, he hath abrogated the old: now that which is disannulled and waxed old, is ready to vanish away."}]}
