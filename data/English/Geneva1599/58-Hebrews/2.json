And how could he have men for his sons, unless his only begotten Son had become brother to men?) seeing that he brought many children unto glory, (Secondly, The Father determined to bring those sons to glory, to wit, out of that ignominy wherein they lay before. Therefore the Son should not have been seen plainly to be made man, unless he had been made like unto other men, that he might come to glory in the selfsame way, by which he should bring others: yea rather, it became him which was Prince of the salvation of others, to be consecrated above others, through those afflictions, Prophet, King, and Priest, which are the parts of that principality for the salvation of others.) that he should consecrate the (The Chieftain, who as he is chiefest in dignity, so is he the first begotten from among the dead, amongst many brethren.)
