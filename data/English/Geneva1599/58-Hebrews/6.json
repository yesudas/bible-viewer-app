Therefore, leaving the doctrine of the (The first principles of Christian religion, which we call the Catechism.) beginning of Christ, let us be led forward unto perfection, (Certain principles of a Catechism, which comprehend the sum of the doctrine of the Gospel, were given in few words and briefly to the rude and ignorant, to wit, the profession of repentance and faith in God: the articles of which doctrine, were demanded of them which were not as yet received members of the Church, at the days appointed for Baptism: and of the children of the faithful which were baptized in their infancy: when hands were laid upon them. And of those articles, two are by name recited: the resurrection of the flesh, and the eternal judgment.) not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,"},{"number":2,"verse":"Of the doctrine of baptisms, and laying on of hands, and of the resurrection from the dead, and of eternal judgment."},{"number":3,"verse":"And this will we do if God permit."},{"number":4,"verse":"(Cross references: : Heb. 10:26; Matt. 12:45; 2 Pet. 1:10) (He addeth a vehemency to his exhortation, and a most sharp threatening of the certain destruction that shall come to them which fall from God and his religion.)
