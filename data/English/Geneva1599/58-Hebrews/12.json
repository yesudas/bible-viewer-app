(He setteth before us, as the mark of this race, Jesus himself our captain, who willingly overcame all the roughness of the same way.) (As it were upon the mark of our faith.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"(An amplification taken of the circumstance of the person, and the things themselves, which he compareth betwixt themselves: for how great is Jesus in comparison of us, and how far more grievous things did he suffer than we?) Consider therefore him that endureth such speaking against of sinners, lest ye should be wearied and faint in your minds."},{"number":4,"verse":"(He taketh an argument of the profit which cometh to us by God’s chastisements, unless we be in fault. First of all because sin, or that rebellious wickedness of our flesh, is by this means turned.) Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin."},{"number":5,"verse":"(Secondly, because they are testimony of his fatherly good will toward us, insomuch that they show themselves to be bastards, which cannot abide to be chastened of God.) And ye have forgotten the consolation, which speaketh unto you as unto children, (Prov. 3:11) My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him."},{"number":6,"verse":"For whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth: and he scourgeth every son that he receiveth."},{"number":7,"verse":"If ye endure chastening, God offered himself unto you as unto sons: for what son is it whom the father chasteneth not?"},{"number":8,"verse":"If therefore ye be without correction, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons."},{"number":9,"verse":"(Thirdly, if all men yield this right to fathers, to whom next after God we owe this life, that they may rightfully correct their children, shall we not be much more subject to that our Father, who is the Author of the spiritual and everlasting life?) Moreover we have had the fathers of our bodies which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: should we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits, that we might live?"},{"number":10,"verse":"(An amplification of the same argument: Those fathers have corrected us after their fancy, for some frail and transitory profit: but God chasteneth and instructeth us for our singular profit, to make us partakers of his holiness: which thing although these our senses do not presently perceive, yet the end of the matter proveth it.) For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure, but he chastened us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness."},{"number":11,"verse":"Now no chastising for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: but afterward, it bringeth the quiet fruit of righteousness, unto them which are thereby exercised."},{"number":12,"verse":"(The conclusion, we must go forward courageously and keep always a right course, and (as far forth as we may) without any staggering or stumbling.) Wherefore lift up your hands which (The description of a man that is out of heart and clean discouraged.) hang down, and your weak knees,"},{"number":13,"verse":"And make (Keep a right course, and so, that you show example of good life for others to follow.) straight steps unto your feet, lest that which is halting, be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed."},{"number":14,"verse":"(Rom. 12:18) (We must live in peace, and holiness with all men.) Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without the which no man shall see the Lord."},{"number":15,"verse":"(We must study to edify one another, both in doctrine and example of life.) Take heed, that no man fall away from the grace of God: let no (That no heresy, or backsliding be an offense.) root of bitterness spring up and trouble you, lest thereby many be defiled."},{"number":16,"verse":"(We must eschew fornication, and a profane mind, that is, such a mind, as giveth not to God his due honor, which wickedness how severely God will at length punish, the horrible example of Esau teacheth us.) Let there be no fornicator, or profane person as (Gen. 25:33) Esau, which for one portion of meat sold his birthright."},{"number":17,"verse":"(Gen. 27:38) For ye know how that afterward also when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no (There was no place left for his repentance: and it appeareth by the effects, what his repentance was, for when he was gone out of his father’s sight, he threatened his brother to kill him.) place to repentance, though he sought that blessing with tears."},{"number":18,"verse":"(Now he applieth the same exhortation, to the Prophetical and kingly office of Christ compared with Moses, after this sort, If the majesty of the Law was so great, how great think you that the glory of Christ and the Gospel is? And this comparison he declareth also particularly.) For ye are not come unto the (Exod. 19:16) mount that might be (Which might be touched with hands, which was of a gross and earthly matter.) touched, nor unto burning fire, nor to blackness and darkness, and tempest,"},{"number":19,"verse":"Neither unto the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which they that heard it, excused themselves, (Exod. 20:19) that the word should not be spoken to them any more."},{"number":20,"verse":"(For they were not able to abide that which was commanded, (Exod. 19:12) yea, though a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:"},{"number":21,"verse":"And so terrible was the (The shape and form which he saw, which was no counterfeit and forged shape, but a true one.) sight which appeared, that Moses said, I fear and quake.)"},{"number":22,"verse":"But ye are come unto the mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the celestial Jerusalem, and to the company of innumerable Angels."},{"number":23,"verse":"And to the assembly and congregation of the first born, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just and (So he calleth them that are taken up into heaven, although one part of them sleep in the earth.) perfect men,"},{"number":24,"verse":"And to Jesus the Mediator of the new Testament, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel."},{"number":25,"verse":"(The applying of the former comparison, If it were not lawful to contemn his word which spake on the earth, how much less his voice which is from heaven?) See that ye despise not him that speaketh: for if they escaped not which refused him, that spake on earth: much more shall we not escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven."},{"number":26,"verse":"(He compareth the steadfast majesty of the Gospel, wherewith the whole world was shaken, and even the very frame of heaven was as it were astonished, with the small and vanishing sound of the governance by the Law.) Whose voice then shook the earth, and now hath declared, saying, (Hag. 2:7) Yet (It appeareth evidently in this that the Prophet speaketh of the calling of the Gentiles, that these words must be referred to the kingdom of Christ.) once more will I shake, not the earth only, but also heaven."},{"number":27,"verse":"And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things which are shaken, as of things which are made with hands, that the things which are not shaken, may remain."},{"number":28,"verse":"(A general exhortation to live reverently and religiously under the most happy subjection of so mighty a king, who as he blesseth his most mightily, so doth he most severely revenge the rebellious.
