Thou therefore suffer affliction as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."},{"number":4,"verse":"No man that warreth, entangleth himself with the affairs of (With affairs of household, or other things that belong to other ordinary businesses.) this life, because he would please him that hath chosen him to be a soldier."},{"number":5,"verse":"(The third admonition: The ministry is like to a game or justing, wherein men strive for the victory, and no man is crowned unless he strive according to the laws which are prescribed, be they never so hard and painful.) And if any man also strive for a mastery, he is not crowned, except he strive as he ought to do."},{"number":6,"verse":"(Another similitude tending to the same end: no man may look for the harvest, unless he first take pains to plow and sow his ground.) The husbandman must labor before he receive the fruits."},{"number":7,"verse":"(All these things cannot be understood, and much less practiced, unless we ask of God and he gives us understanding.) Consider what I say: and the Lord give thee understanding in all things."},{"number":8,"verse":"(He confirmeth plainly two principles of our faith, which are always assaulted of heretics, the one whereof (to wit, that Christ is the true Messiah made man of the seed of David) is the ground of our salvation: and the other is the highest part of it, to wit, that he is risen again from the dead.) Remember that Jesus Christ, made of the seed of David, was raised again from the dead according to my Gospel,"},{"number":9,"verse":"(The taking away of an objection: Truth it is, that he is kept in prison, as an evildoer, yet there is no cause, why therefore some should go about to derogate credit from his Gospel, seeing that notwithstanding God did bless his ministry, nay rather, that example of this his captivity and patience did sundry ways confirm the Church in the hope of a better life.) Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil doer, even unto bonds: but the word of God is not bound."},{"number":10,"verse":"Therefore I suffer all things for the elect’s sake, that they might also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory."},{"number":11,"verse":"(The fourth admonition: we ought not to contend upon words and questions, which are not only unprofitable, but also for the most part hurtful: but rather upon this, how we may frame ourselves to all manner of patience, and to die also with Christ (that is to say, for Christ’s Name) because that is the plain way to the most glorious life: as contrariwise the falling away of men can diminish no part of the truth of God, although by such means, they procure most certain destruction to themselves.) It is a true saying, For if we be dead together with him: we also shall live together with him. (If we be afflicted with Christ, and for Christ’s sake.)

Study to show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, dividing the word of truth (By adding nothing to it, neither overslipping anything, neither mangling it, nor renting it in sunder, nor wresting of it: but marking diligently what his hearers are able to hear, and what is fit to edifying.) aright."},{"number":16,"verse":"(Mark and watch, and see they creep not on further.) Stay profane, and vain babblings: (He discovereth the subtlety of Satan, who beginning with these principles draweth us by little and little to ungodliness through the means of that wicked and profane babbling, still creeping on: which he proveth by the horrible example of them that taught that, the resurrection was already past.) for they shall increase unto more ungodliness."},{"number":17,"verse":"And their word shall fret as a canker: of which sort is Hymenaeus and Philetus."},{"number":18,"verse":"Which as concerning the truth have erred from the mark, saying that the resurrection is past already, and do destroy the faith of certain."},{"number":19,"verse":"(A digression: wherein he salveth that offense that rose by their falling away: showing first, that the elect are out of all danger of any such falling away: secondly, that they are known to God and not to us: and therefore it is no marvel if we count hypocrites oftentimes for true brethren: but we must take heed that we be not like them, but rather that we be indeed, such as we are said to be.) But the foundation of God remaineth sure, and hath this seal, The Lord knoweth who are his: and, Let everyone that (That serveth and worshippeth him, and is as it were named of him, a faithful man or Christian.) calleth on the Name of Christ, depart from iniquity."},{"number":20,"verse":"(The taking away of an objection: it is no dishonor to the good man of the house, that he hath not in a great house all vessels of one sort and for one service, but we must look to this, that we be found vessels prepared to honor.) Notwithstanding in a great house are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, (Rom. 9:21) and some for honor, and some unto dishonor."},{"number":21,"verse":"If any man therefore (By these words is meant the execution of the matter, and not the cause: for in that we purge ourselves, it is not to be attributeth to any free will that is in us, but to God, who freely and wholly worketh in us a good and an effectual will.) purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meet for the Lord, and prepared unto every good work."},{"number":22,"verse":"(Returning to the matter from whence he digressed, verse 16, he warneth him to exercise himself in weighty matters, and such as pertain to godliness.)
