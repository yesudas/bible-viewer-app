I turned and considered all the oppressions that are wrought under the sun, and behold, the tears of the oppressed, and none comforteth them, and lo, the strength is of the hand of them that oppress them, and none comforteth them."},{"number":2,"verse":"Wherefore I praised the (Because they are no more subject to these oppressions.) dead which now are dead, above the living, which are yet alive."},{"number":3,"verse":"And I count him (He speaketh according to the judgment of the flesh, which cannot abide to feel or see troubles.) better than them both, which hath not yet been: for he hath not seen the evil works which are wrought under the sun."},{"number":4,"verse":"Also I beheld all travail, and all (The more perfect that the work is, the more it is envied of the wicked.) perfection of works, that this is the envy of a man against his neighbor: this also is vanity and vexation of spirit."},{"number":5,"verse":"The fool foldeth his hands, and (For idleness he is compelled to destroy himself.) eateth up his own flesh."},{"number":6,"verse":"Better is an handful with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and vexation of spirit."},{"number":7,"verse":"Again I returned, and saw vanity under the sun."},{"number":8,"verse":"There is one alone, and there is not a second, which hath neither son nor brother, yet is there none end of all his travail, neither can his eye be satisfied with riches: neither doth he think, For whom do I travail and defraud my soul of pleasures? this also is vanity, this is an evil travail."},{"number":9,"verse":"(Forasmuch as when man is alone, he can neither help himself nor others, he showeth that men ought to live in mutual society to the intent they may be profitable one to another, and that their things may increase.) Two are better wages for their labor."},{"number":10,"verse":"For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe unto him that is alone: for he falleth, and there is not a second to lift him up."},{"number":11,"verse":"Also if two sleep together, then shall they have heat: but to one how should there be heat?"},{"number":12,"verse":"And if one overcome him, two shall stand against him: and a threefold (By this proverb he declareth how necessary it is, that men should live in society.) cord is not easily broken."},{"number":13,"verse":"Better is a poor and wise child, than an old and foolish King, which will no more be admonished."},{"number":14,"verse":"For out of the (That is, from a poor and base estate, or out of trouble and prison, as Joseph did, Gen. 41:14.) prison he cometh forth to reign: when as he that is (Meaning, that is born a King.) born in his kingdom, is made poor."},{"number":15,"verse":"I beheld all the living, which walk under the Sun (Which follow and flatter the King’s son, or him that shall succeed, to enter into credit with them in hope of gain.) with the second child, which shall stand up in his place."},{"number":16,"verse":"There is none (They never cease by all means to creep into favor, but when they obtain not, their greedy desires, they think themselves abused, as others have been in time past, and so care no more for him.) end of all the people, nor of all that were before them, and they that come after, shall not rejoice in him: surely this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.
