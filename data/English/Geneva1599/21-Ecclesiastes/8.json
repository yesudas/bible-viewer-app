Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? the wisdom of a man doth make his face (That is, doth get him favor and prosperity.) to shine: and (Whereas before he was proud and arrogant, he shall become humble and meek.) the strength of his face shall be changed."},{"number":2,"verse":"I advertise thee to take heed to the (That is, that thou obey the king and keep the oath that thou hast made for the same cause.) mouth of the king, and to the word of the oath of God."},{"number":3,"verse":"(Withdraw not thyself lightly from the obedience of thy prince.)
