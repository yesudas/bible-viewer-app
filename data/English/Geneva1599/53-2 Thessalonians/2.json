Now (The second part of the Epistle, containing an excellent prophecy of the state of the Church, which shall be from the Apostles’ times unto the latter day of judgment.) we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our (If we think earnestly upon that immeasurable glory, which we shall be partakers of with Christ, it will be an excellent remedy for us against wavering, and impatience, so that neither the glistering of the world shall allure us, nor the dreadful sight of the cross dismay us.) assembling unto him,"},{"number":2,"verse":"(We must take heed of false prophets, especially in this matter, which go about to deceive, and that for the most part, after three sorts: for either they brag of fained prophetical revelations, or they bring conjectures and reasons of their own, or use counterfeit writings.) That ye be not suddenly moved from your mind, nor troubled neither by (By dreams and fables, which men pretend to be spiritual revelations.) spirit, nor by (Either by word of mouth, or by books written.) word, nor by (Either by forged letters, or falsely glossed upon.) letter, as it were from us, as though the day of Christ were at hand."},{"number":3,"verse":"Let no man deceive you by any means: (The Apostle foretelleth that before the coming of the Lord, there shall be a throne set up clean contrary to Christ’s glory, wherein that wicked man shall sit, and transfer all things that appertain to God, to himself, and many shall fall away from God to him.) for that day shall not come, except there come a departing first, and that (By speaking of one, he pointed out the body of the tyrannous and persecuting Church.) that man of sin be disclosed, even the son of perdition."},{"number":4,"verse":"Which is an adversary, and (All men know who he is that saith he can shut up heaven and open it at his pleasure, and took upon him to be Lord and master above all Kings and Princes, before whom Kings and Princes fall down and worship, honoring that Antichrist as a god.) exalteth himself against all that is called God, or that is worshipped: (He foretelleth that Antichrist, (that is, whosoever he be that shall occupy that seat that falleth away from God) shall not reign without the Church, but in the very bosom of the Church.) so that he doth sit as God in the Temple of God, showing himself that he is God."},{"number":5,"verse":"(This prophecy was continually declared to the Ancient Church, but it was neglected of them that followed.) Remember ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"},{"number":6,"verse":"And now ye know (What hindereth and stayeth.) what withholdeth, that he might be revealed in his time."},{"number":7,"verse":"(Even in the Apostles’ time the first foundations of the Apostolical seat were laid, but yet so, that they deceived men.) For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: (He foretelleth that when the empire of Rome is taken away, the seat that falleth away from God shall succeed and shall hold his place, as the old writers, Tertullian, Chrysostomes and Jerome do expound it.) only he which now (He which is now in authority and ruleth all, to wit, the Roman Empire.) withholdeth, shall let till he be taken out of the way."},{"number":8,"verse":"(That wickedness shall at length be detected by the word of the Lord, and utterly be abolished by Christ’s coming.)
