I (Having dispatched those things which pertain to doctrine, he speaketh now in the second place of the other part of the ministry of the word, to wit, of public prayers. And first of all declaring this question, for whom we ought to pray: he teacheth that we must pray for all men, and especially for all manner of magistrates, which thing was at that time somewhat doubted of, seeing that kings, yea and the most part of magistrates were at that time enemies of the Church.) Exhort therefore, that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men,"},{"number":2,"verse":"For Kings, and for all that are in authority, (An argument taken of the end: to wit, because that magistrates are appointed to this end, that men might peaceably and quietly live in all godliness and honesty, and therefore must we commend them especially to God, that they may faithfully execute so necessary an office.) that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life, in all godliness, and (This word containeth all kind of duty, which is to be used amongst men in all their affairs.) honesty."},{"number":3,"verse":"For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior."},{"number":4,"verse":"(Another argument, why Churches or Congregations ought to pray for all men, without any difference of nation, kind, age, or order: to wit, because the Lord by calling of all sorts, yea, sometimes those that are greatest enemies to the Gospel, will have his Church gathered together after this sort, and therefore prayers to be made for all.) Who will that all men shall be saved, and come unto the acknowledging of the truth."},{"number":5,"verse":"(God would not else be manifested to be the only God of all men, unless he would show his goodness in saving of all sorts of men: neither should Christ be seen to be the only mediator between God and all sorts of men, by having taken upon him that nature of man which is common to all men, unless he had satisfied for all sorts of men, and made intercession for all.) For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, which is the (Christ Jesus which was made man.) man Christ Jesus,"},{"number":6,"verse":"Who gave himself a ransom for all men, (A confirmation, because that even to the Gentiles in the secret of salvation now opened and made manifest the Apostle himself being appointed properly to this office, which he doth faithfully and sincerely execute.) to be that testimony in due time,"},{"number":7,"verse":"(Cross references: : 2 Tim. 1:11) Whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an Apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not) even a teacher of the Gentiles in (Faithfully and sincerely: and by faith he meaneth wholesome and sound doctrine, and by truth, an upright and sincere handling of it.) faith and verity."},{"number":8,"verse":"(He hath spoken of the persons for whom we must pray: and now he teacheth that the difference of places is taken away: for in times past, one only nation, and in one certain place, came together to public service: but now Churches or Congregations are gathered together everywhere (orderly and decently) and men come together to serve God publicly with common prayer, neither must we strive for the nation or for the purification of the body, or for the place, but for the mind, to have it clean from all offense, and full of sure trust and confidence.) I will therefore that the men pray, everywhere (He putteth the sign for the thing itself, the lifting up of hands, for the calling upon God.) lifting up pure hands without (Without these griefs and offenses of the mind, which hinder us from calling upon God with a good conscience.) wrath, or (Doubting which is against faith, James 1:6.) doubting."},{"number":9,"verse":"(1 Pet. 3:3) (Thirdly he appointeth women to learn in the public assemblies with silence and modesty, being comely appareled without any riot or excess in their apparel.)
