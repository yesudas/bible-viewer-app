Wherefore it be requisite before he be chosen, to examine well his learning, his gifts, and ableness, and his life.) If any man (He speaketh not here of ambitious seeking, than the which there cannot be a worse fault in the Church, but general of the mind, and disposition of man, framed and disposed to help and edify the Church of God, when and wheresoever it shall please the Lord.) desire the office of a Bishop, he desireth a worthy work."},{"number":2,"verse":"(Cross references: : Titus 2:6) A Bishop therefore must be unreproveable, the husband of one (Therefore he that shutteth out married men from the office of Bishops, only because they are married, is Antichrist.) wife, watching, temperate, modest, harborous, apt to teach,"},{"number":3,"verse":"Not (A common tippler, and one that will sit by it.) given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, no fighter, not covetous."},{"number":4,"verse":"One that can rule his own house honestly, having children under obedience with all honesty."},{"number":5,"verse":"For if any cannot rule his own house, how shall he care for the Church of God?"},{"number":6,"verse":"He may not be a young scholar, lest he being puffed up fall into the (Lest by reason that he is advanced to that degree, he take occasion to be proud, which will undo him, and so he fall into the same condemnation that the devil himself is fallen into.) condemnation of the devil."},{"number":7,"verse":"He must also be well reported of, even of them which are without, lest he fall into rebuke, and the snare of the devil."},{"number":8,"verse":"(Likewise the Deacons must first be proved that there may be a good trial of their honesty, truth, sobriety, mind, void of covetousness, that they are well instructed in the doctrine of faith, and to be short, of their good conscience and integrity.)
