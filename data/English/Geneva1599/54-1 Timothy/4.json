Which speak lies through (For they will as it were practice the art of disguised persons and players, that we may not think they will lie lurking in some one corner, or keep any resemblance of shamefastness.) hypocrisy, and have their (Whose conscience waxed so hard, that there grew an hard fleshiness over it, and so became to have a canker on it, and now at length required of very necessity to be burned with an hot iron.) consciences burned with an hot iron,"},{"number":3,"verse":"(He setteth down two kinds of this false doctrine, to wit, the Law of sole life, and difference of meats.) Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats (He proveth that he justly called such doctrines devilish, first, because the teachers of them make laws of things which are not their own: for have they created the meats?) which God hath created (Secondly, because they overthrow with their decrees, the end wherefore they were created of God, to wit, that we should use them.) to be received (Thirdly, for that by this means they rob God of his glory, who will be honored in the use of them.
