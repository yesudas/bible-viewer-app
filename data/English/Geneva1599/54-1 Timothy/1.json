And the first admonition is this, that no innovation be made either in the Apostle’s doctrine itself, or in the manner of teaching it.) As I besought thee to abide still in Ephesus, when I departed into Macedonia, so do, that thou mayest warn some, that they teach none other doctrine,"},{"number":4,"verse":"(The doctrine is corrupted not only by false opinions, but also by vain and curious speculations: the declaration and utterance whereof can nothing help our faith.) Neither that they give heed to fables and (He noteth out one kind of vain question.) genealogies which are endless, which breed questions rather than godly edifying which is by faith."},{"number":5,"verse":"(Cross references: : Rom. 13:10) (The second admonition is, that the right use and practice of the doctrine must be joined with the doctrine. And that consisteth in pure charity, and a good conscience, and true faith.) For the end of the (Of the Law.) commandment is (There is neither love without a good conscience, nor a good conscience without faith, nor faith without the word of God.) love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."},{"number":6,"verse":"(That which he spake before generally of vain and curious controversies, he applieth to them, which pretending a zeal of the Law, dwelled upon outward things, and never made an end of babbling of foolish trifles.) From the which things some have erred, and have turned unto vain jangling."},{"number":7,"verse":"(There are none more unlearned, and more impudent in usurping the name of holiness, than foolish sophistical babblers.) They would be doctors of the Law, and yet understand not what they speak, neither whereof they affirm."},{"number":8,"verse":"(The taking away of an objection. He condemneth not the Law, but requireth the right use and practice of it.) And we know, that the Law is good, if a man use it lawfully."},{"number":9,"verse":"(He indeed escapeth the curse of the Law, and therefore doth not abhor it, who fleeing and eschewing those things which the Law condemneth, giveth himself with all his heart to observe it: and not he that maketh a vain babbling of outward and curious matters.) Knowing this, that the Law is not given unto a (And such a one is he, whom the Lord hath endued with true doctrine, and with the holy Ghost.) righteous man, but unto the lawless and disobedient, to the ungodly, and to (To such as make an art as it were of sinning.) sinners, to the unholy, and to the profane, to murderers of fathers and mothers, to manslayers,"},{"number":10,"verse":"To whoremongers, to buggerers, to menstealers, to liars, to the perjured, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to wholesome doctrine,"},{"number":11,"verse":"(He setteth against fond and vain babbling, not only the Law, but the Gospel also, which condemneth not, but greatly commendeth the wholesome doctrine contained in the commandments of God, and therefore he calleth it a glorious Gospel, and the Gospel of the blessed God, the virtue whereof these babblers knew not.) Which is according to the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, (A reason why neither any other Gospel is to be taught than he hath taught in the Church, neither after any other sort, because there is no other Gospel besides that which God committed to him.) which is committed unto me."},{"number":12,"verse":"(He maintaineth of necessity his Apostleship against some that did carp at his former life, debasing himself, even to hell, to advance Christ’s only mercy, wherewith he abolished all those his former doings.) Therefore I thank him which hath made me (Which gave me strength, not only when I had no will to do well, but also when I was wholly given to evil.) strong, that is, Christ Jesus our Lord: for he counted me faithful, and put me in his service:"},{"number":13,"verse":"When before I was a (These are the preparative works which Paul braggeth of.) blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an oppressor: but I was received to mercy: for I did it ignorantly through unbelief."},{"number":14,"verse":"But the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant (He proveth this change by the effects, for that, that he that was a profane man, is become a believer: and he that did most outrageously persecute Christ, burneth now in love towards him.) with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus."},{"number":15,"verse":"(He turneth the reproach of the adversaries upon their own head, showing that this singular example of the goodness of God, redoundeth to the commodity of the whole Church.) This is a (Worthy to be believed.) true saying, and by all means worthy to be received, that (Matt. 4:13; Mark 2:17) Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief."},{"number":16,"verse":"Notwithstanding for this cause was I received to mercy, that Jesus Christ should first show on me all long suffering unto the ensample of them, which shall in time to come believe in him unto eternal life."},{"number":17,"verse":"(He breaketh out into an exclamation, even for very zeal of mind, for that he cannot satisfy himself in amplifying the grace of God.) Now unto the king everlasting, immortal, invisible, unto God (See John 17:3.) only wise, be honor, and glory, for ever, and ever, Amen."},{"number":18,"verse":"(The conclusion of both the former fatherly admonitions, to wit, that Timothy striving manfully against all lets, being called to the ministry according to many prophecies which went before of him, should both maintain the doctrine which he had received, and keep also a good conscience.) This commandment commit I unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies, which went before upon thee, that thou (By the help of them.) by them shouldest fight a good fight,"},{"number":19,"verse":"Having (Wholesome and sound doctrine.) faith and a good conscience, (Whosoever keep not a good conscience, do lose also by little and little the gift of understanding: which he proveth by two most lamentable examples.) which some have put away, and as concerning faith, have made shipwreck."},{"number":20,"verse":"Of whom is Hymenaeus, and Alexander, whom I have (Cast out of the Church, and so delivered them to Satan.) delivered unto Satan, that they might (That by their smart they might learn what it is to blaspheme.) learn not to blaspheme. (Such as fall from God, and his religion, are not to be suffered in the Church, but rather ought to be excommunicated.) (1 Cor. 5:5)"}]}
