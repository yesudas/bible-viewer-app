Macedonia was in the northern region of Greece.) were ready to send an offering a year ago. In fact, it was your enthusiasm that stirred up many of the Macedonian believers to begin giving."},{"number":3,"verse":"But I am sending these brothers to be sure you really are ready, as I have been telling them, and that your money is all collected.

And when we take your gifts to those who need them, they will thank God."},{"number":12,"verse":"So two good things will result from this ministry of giving—the needs of the believers in Jerusalem (Greek of God’s holy people.) will be met, and they will joyfully express their thanks to God."},{"number":13,"verse":"As a result of your ministry, they will give glory to God.
