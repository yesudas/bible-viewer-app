But they are also filled with abundant joy, which has overflowed in rich generosity."},{"number":3,"verse":"For I can testify that they gave not only what they could afford, but far more. And they did it of their own free will."},{"number":4,"verse":"They begged us again and again for the privilege of sharing in the gift for the believers in Jerusalem. (Greek for God’s holy people.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"They even did more than we had hoped, for their first action was to give themselves to the Lord and to us, just as God wanted them to do."},{"number":6,"verse":"So we have urged Titus, who encouraged your giving in the first place, to return to you and encourage you to finish this ministry of giving."},{"number":7,"verse":"Since you excel in so many ways—in your faith, your gifted speakers, your knowledge, your enthusiasm, and your love from us (Some manuscripts read your love for us.) —I want you to excel also in this gracious act of giving."},{"number":8,"verse":"I am not commanding you to do this. But I am testing how genuine your love is by comparing it with the eagerness of the other churches."},{"number":9,"verse":"You know the generous grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Last year you were the first who wanted to give, and you were the first to begin doing it."},{"number":11,"verse":"Now you should finish what you started. Let the eagerness you showed in the beginning be matched now by your giving. Give in proportion to what you have."},{"number":12,"verse":"Whatever you give is acceptable if you give it eagerly. And give according to what you have, not what you don’t have."},{"number":13,"verse":"Of course, I don’t mean your giving should make life easy for others and hard for yourselves. I only mean that there should be some equality."},{"number":14,"verse":"Right now you have plenty and can help those who are in need. Later, they will have plenty and can share with you when you need it. In this way, things will be equal."},{"number":15,"verse":"As the Scriptures say, “Those who gathered a lot had nothing left over, and those who gathered only a little had enough.” (Exod 16:18.)"},{"number":16,"verse":"(Titus and His Companions) But thank God!

He is now even more enthusiastic because of his great confidence in you."},{"number":23,"verse":"If anyone asks about Titus, say that he is my partner who works with me to help you. And the brothers with him have been sent by the churches, (Greek are apostles of the churches.) and they bring honor to Christ."},{"number":24,"verse":"So show them your love, and prove to all the churches that our boasting about you is justified."}]}
