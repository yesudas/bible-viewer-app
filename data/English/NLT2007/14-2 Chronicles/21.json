(Masoretic Text reads of Israel; also in 21:4. The author of Chronicles sees Judah as representative of the true Israel. (Some Hebrew manuscripts, Greek and Syriac versions, and Latin Vulgate read of Judah.))"},{"number":3,"verse":"Their father had given each of them valuable gifts of silver, gold, and costly items, and also some of Judah’s fortified towns.
