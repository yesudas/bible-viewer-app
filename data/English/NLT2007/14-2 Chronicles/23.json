Treason!”"},{"number":14,"verse":"Then Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders who were in charge of the troops, “Take her to the soldiers in front of the Temple, (Or Bring her out from between the ranks; or Take her out of the Temple precincts.

They went through the upper gate and into the palace, and they seated the king on the royal throne."},{"number":21,"verse":"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was peaceful because Athaliah had been killed."}]}
