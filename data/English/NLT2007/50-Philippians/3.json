We rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us. We put no confidence in human effort,"},{"number":4,"verse":"though I could have confidence in my own effort if anyone could. Indeed, if others have reason for confidence in their own efforts, I have even more!"},{"number":5,"verse":"I was circumcised when I was eight days old. I am a pure-blooded citizen of Israel and a member of the tribe of Benjamin—a real Hebrew if there ever was one!

I want to suffer with him, sharing in his death,"},{"number":11,"verse":"so that one way or another I will experience the resurrection from the dead!"},{"number":12,"verse":"Pressing toward the Goal I don’t mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have already reached perfection.
