He said, “This Jesus I’m telling you about is the Messiah.”"},{"number":4,"verse":"Some of the Jews who listened were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with many God-fearing Greek men and quite a few prominent women. (Some manuscripts read quite a few of the wives of the leading men.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"But some of the Jews were jealous, so they gathered some troublemakers from the marketplace to form a mob and start a riot. They attacked the home of Jason, searching for Paul and Silas so they could drag them out to the crowd. (Or the city council.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"Not finding them there, they dragged out Jason and some of the other believers (Greek brothers; also in 17:10, 14.) instead and took them before the city council. “Paul and Silas have caused trouble all over the world,” they shouted, “and now they are here disturbing our city, too."},{"number":7,"verse":"And Jason has welcomed them into his home.

When he told them about Jesus and his resurrection, they said, “What’s this babbler trying to say with these strange ideas he’s picked up?” Others said, “He seems to be preaching about some foreign gods.”"},{"number":19,"verse":"Then they took him to the high council of the city. (Or the most learned society of philosophers in the city. Greek reads the Areopagus.) “Come and tell us about this new teaching,” they said."},{"number":20,"verse":"“You are saying some rather strange things, and we want to know what it’s all about.”"},{"number":21,"verse":"(It should be explained that all the Athenians as well as the foreigners in Athens seemed to spend all their time discussing the latest ideas.)"},{"number":22,"verse":"So Paul, standing before the council, (Traditionally rendered standing in the middle of Mars Hill; Greek reads standing in the middle of the Areopagus.) addressed them as follows: “Men of Athens, I notice that you are very religious in every way,"},{"number":23,"verse":"for as I was walking along I saw your many shrines. And one of your altars had this inscription on it: ‘To an Unknown God.’ This God, whom you worship without knowing, is the one I’m telling you about."},{"number":24,"verse":"“He is the God who made the world and everything in it. Since he is Lord of heaven and earth, he doesn’t live in man-made temples,"},{"number":25,"verse":"and human hands can’t serve his needs—for he has no needs. He himself gives life and breath to everything, and he satisfies every need."},{"number":26,"verse":"From one man (Greek From one; other manuscripts read From one blood.) he created all the nations throughout the whole earth. He decided beforehand when they should rise and fall, and he determined their boundaries."},{"number":27,"verse":"“His purpose was for the nations to seek after God and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him—though he is not far from any one of us."},{"number":28,"verse":"For in him we live and move and exist. As some of your (Some manuscripts read our.) own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’"},{"number":29,"verse":"And since this is true, we shouldn’t think of God as an idol designed by craftsmen from gold or silver or stone."},{"number":30,"verse":"“God overlooked people’s ignorance about these things in earlier times, but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent of their sins and turn to him."},{"number":31,"verse":"For he has set a day for judging the world with justice by the man he has appointed, and he proved to everyone who this is by raising him from the dead.”"},{"number":32,"verse":"When they heard Paul speak about the resurrection of the dead, some laughed in contempt, but others said, “We want to hear more about this later.”"},{"number":33,"verse":"That ended Paul’s discussion with them,"},{"number":34,"verse":"but some joined him and became believers. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the council, (Greek an Areopagite.) a woman named Damaris, and others with them."}]}
