Now I will pour out judgment on you for the evil you have done to them."},{"number":3,"verse":"But I will gather together the remnant of my flock from the countries where I have driven them. I will bring them back to their own sheepfold, and they will be fruitful and increase in number."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then I will appoint responsible shepherds who will care for them, and they will never be afraid again.

For it is because of Jerusalem’s prophets that wickedness has filled this land.”"},{"number":16,"verse":"This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says to his people: “Do not listen to these prophets when they prophesy to you, filling you with futile hopes. They are making up everything they say. They do not speak for the LORD!"},{"number":17,"verse":"They keep saying to those who despise my word, ‘Don’t worry! The LORD says you will have peace!’ And to those who stubbornly follow their own desires, they say, ‘No harm will come your way!’"},{"number":18,"verse":"“Have any of these prophets been in the LORD’s presence to hear what he is really saying?
