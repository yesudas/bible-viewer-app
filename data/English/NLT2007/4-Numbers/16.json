Compare 2 Tim 2:19.) and who is holy. The LORD will allow only those whom he selects to enter his own presence."},{"number":6,"verse":"Korah, you and all your followers must prepare your incense burners."},{"number":7,"verse":"Light fires in them tomorrow, and burn incense before the LORD.

I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, and I have never hurt a single one of them.”"},{"number":16,"verse":"And Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers must come here tomorrow and present yourselves before the LORD.
