The oppressors have great power, and their victims are helpless."},{"number":2,"verse":"So I concluded that the dead are better off than the living."},{"number":3,"verse":"But most fortunate of all are those who are not yet born. For they have not seen all the evil that is done under the sun."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then I observed that most people are motivated to success because they envy their neighbors.
