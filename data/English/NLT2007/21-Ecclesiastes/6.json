This is meaningless—a sickening tragedy."},{"number":3,"verse":"A man might have a hundred children and live to be very old. But if he finds no satisfaction in life and doesn’t even get a decent burial, it would have been better for him to be born dead."},{"number":4,"verse":"His birth would have been meaningless, and he would have ended in darkness. He wouldn’t even have had a name,"},{"number":5,"verse":"and he would never have seen the sun or known of its existence. Yet he would have had more peace than in growing up to be an unhappy man."},{"number":6,"verse":"He might live a thousand years twice over but still not find contentment. And since he must die like everyone else—well, what’s the use?"},{"number":7,"verse":"All people spend their lives scratching for food, but they never seem to have enough."},{"number":8,"verse":"So are wise people really better off than fools?
