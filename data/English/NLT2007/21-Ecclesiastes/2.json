Let’s look for the ‘good things’ in life.” But I found that this, too, was meaningless."},{"number":2,"verse":"So I said, “Laughter is silly. What good does it do to seek pleasure?”"},{"number":3,"verse":"After much thought, I decided to cheer myself with wine. And while still seeking wisdom, I clutched at foolishness. In this way, I tried to experience the only happiness most people find during their brief life in this world."},{"number":4,"verse":"I also tried to find meaning by building huge homes for myself and by planting beautiful vineyards."},{"number":5,"verse":"I made gardens and parks, filling them with all kinds of fruit trees."},{"number":6,"verse":"I built reservoirs to collect the water to irrigate my many flourishing groves."},{"number":7,"verse":"I bought slaves, both men and women, and others were born into my household. I also owned large herds and flocks, more than any of the kings who had lived in Jerusalem before me."},{"number":8,"verse":"I collected great sums of silver and gold, the treasure of many kings and provinces.

There was nothing really worthwhile anywhere."},{"number":12,"verse":"(The Wise and the Foolish) So I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and madness (for who can do this better than I, the king? (The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.) )."},{"number":13,"verse":"I thought, “Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness."},{"number":14,"verse":"For the wise can see where they are going, but fools walk in the dark.” Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate."},{"number":15,"verse":"Both will die. So I said to myself, “Since I will end up the same as the fool, what’s the value of all my wisdom? This is all so meaningless!”"},{"number":16,"verse":"For the wise and the foolish both die.

But if a sinner becomes wealthy, God takes the wealth away and gives it to those who please him. This, too, is meaningless—like chasing the wind."}]}
