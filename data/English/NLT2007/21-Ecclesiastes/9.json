{"bibleAbbr":"NLT2007","bookName":"Ecclesiastes","bookEnglishName":"Ecclesiastes","chapterNumber":9,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"Death Comes to All This, too, I carefully explored: Even though the actions of godly and wise people are in God’s hands, no one knows whether God will show them favor."},{"number":2,"verse":"The same destiny ultimately awaits everyone, whether righteous or wicked, good or bad, (As in Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew lacks or bad.) ceremonially clean or unclean, religious or irreligious. Good people receive the same treatment as sinners, and people who make promises to God are treated like people who don’t."},{"number":3,"verse":"It seems so wrong that everyone under the sun suffers the same fate. Already twisted by evil, people choose their own mad course, for they have no hope. There is nothing ahead but death anyway."},{"number":4,"verse":"There is hope only for the living. As they say, “It’s better to be a live dog than a dead lion!”"},{"number":5,"verse":"The living at least know they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, nor are they remembered."},{"number":6,"verse":"Whatever they did in their lifetime—loving, hating, envying—is all long gone. They no longer play a part in anything here on earth."},{"number":7,"verse":"So go ahead. Eat your food with joy, and drink your wine with a happy heart, for God approves of this!"},{"number":8,"verse":"Wear fine clothes, with a splash of cologne!"},{"number":9,"verse":"Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun. The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil."},{"number":10,"verse":"Whatever you do, do well. For when you go to the grave, (Hebrew to Sheol.) there will be no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom."},{"number":11,"verse":"I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn’t always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn’t always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don’t always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time."},{"number":12,"verse":"People can never predict when hard times might come. Like fish in a net or birds in a trap, people are caught by sudden tragedy."},{"number":13,"verse":"Thoughts on Wisdom and Folly Here is another bit of wisdom that has impressed me as I have watched the way our world works."},{"number":14,"verse":"There was a small town with only a few people, and a great king came with his army and besieged it."},{"number":15,"verse":"A poor, wise man knew how to save the town, and so it was rescued. But afterward no one thought to thank him."},{"number":16,"verse":"So even though wisdom is better than strength, those who are wise will be despised if they are poor. What they say will not be appreciated for long."},{"number":17,"verse":"Better to hear the quiet words of a wise person than the shouts of a foolish king."},{"number":18,"verse":"Better to have wisdom than weapons of war, but one sinner can destroy much that is good."}]}
