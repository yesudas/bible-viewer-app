She has become a home for demons. She is a hideout for every foul (Greek unclean; also in each of the two following phrases.) spirit, a hideout for every foul vulture and every foul and dreadful animal. (Some manuscripts condense the last two lines to read a hideout for every foul [unclean] and dreadful vulture.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"For all the nations have fallen (Some manuscripts read have drunk.) because of the wine of her passionate immorality.
