What can we do?”"},{"number":5,"verse":"So the palace and city administrators, together with the elders and the guardians of the king’s sons, sent this message to Jehu: “We are your servants and will do anything you tell us. We will not make anyone king; do whatever you think is best.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"Jehu responded with a second letter: “If you are on my side and are going to obey me, bring the heads of your master’s sons to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.” Now the seventy sons of the king were being cared for by the leaders of Samaria, where they had been raised since childhood."},{"number":7,"verse":"When the letter arrived, the leaders killed all seventy of the king’s sons. They placed their heads in baskets and presented them to Jehu at Jezreel."},{"number":8,"verse":"A messenger went to Jehu and said, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.” So Jehu ordered, “Pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate, and leave them there until morning.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"In the morning he went out and spoke to the crowd that had gathered around them. “You are not to blame,” he told them. “I am the one who conspired against my master and killed him.

Don’t let a single one escape!” So they killed them all with their swords, and the guards and officers dragged their bodies outside.

Then Jehu’s men went into the innermost fortress (Hebrew city.) of the temple of Baal."},{"number":26,"verse":"They dragged out the sacred pillar (As in Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew reads sacred pillars.) used in the worship of Baal and burned it."},{"number":27,"verse":"They smashed the sacred pillar and wrecked the temple of Baal, converting it into a public toilet, as it remains to this day."},{"number":28,"verse":"In this way, Jehu destroyed every trace of Baal worship from Israel."},{"number":29,"verse":"He did not, however, destroy the gold calves at Bethel and Dan, with which Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to sin."},{"number":30,"verse":"Nonetheless the LORD said to Jehu, “You have done well in following my instructions to destroy the family of Ahab.
