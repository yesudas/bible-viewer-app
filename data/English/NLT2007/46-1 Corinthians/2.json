Rather than using clever and persuasive speeches, I relied only on the power of the Holy Spirit."},{"number":5,"verse":"I did this so you would trust not in human wisdom but in the power of God."},{"number":6,"verse":"Yet when I am among mature believers, I do speak with words of wisdom, but not the kind of wisdom that belongs to this world or to the rulers of this world, who are soon forgotten."},{"number":7,"verse":"No, the wisdom we speak of is the mystery of God (Greek But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery.) —his plan that was previously hidden, even though he made it for our ultimate glory before the world began."},{"number":8,"verse":"But the rulers of this world have not understood it; if they had, they would not have crucified our glorious Lord."},{"number":9,"verse":"That is what the Scriptures mean when they say, “No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.” (Isa 64:4.)"},{"number":10,"verse":"But (Some manuscripts read For.) it was to us that God revealed these things by his Spirit.
