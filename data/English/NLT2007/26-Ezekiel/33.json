If they had listened to the warning, they could have saved their lives."},{"number":6,"verse":"But if the watchman sees the enemy coming and doesn’t sound the alarm to warn the people, he is responsible for their captivity.

We are many; surely the land has been given to us as a possession.’"},{"number":25,"verse":"So tell these people, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You eat meat with blood in it, you worship idols, (The Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung.) and you murder the innocent.

They say to each other, ‘Come on, let’s go hear the prophet tell us what the LORD is saying!’"},{"number":31,"verse":"So my people come pretending to be sincere and sit before you. They listen to your words, but they have no intention of doing what you say. Their mouths are full of lustful words, and their hearts seek only after money."},{"number":32,"verse":"You are very entertaining to them, like someone who sings love songs with a beautiful voice or plays fine music on an instrument.
