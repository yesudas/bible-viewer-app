The water flowed around it like a river, streaming to all the trees nearby."},{"number":5,"verse":"This great tree towered high, higher than all the other trees around it. It prospered and grew long thick branches because of all the water at its roots."},{"number":6,"verse":"The birds nested in its branches, and in its shade all the wild animals gave birth.
