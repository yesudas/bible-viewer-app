For tomorrow I will bring a swarm of locusts on your country."},{"number":5,"verse":"They will cover the land so that you won’t be able to see the ground.

When morning arrived, the east wind had brought the locusts."},{"number":14,"verse":"And the locusts swarmed over the whole land of Egypt, settling in dense swarms from one end of the country to the other. It was the worst locust plague in Egyptian history, and there has never been another one like it."},{"number":15,"verse":"For the locusts covered the whole country and darkened the land. They devoured every plant in the fields and all the fruit on the trees that had survived the hailstorm. Not a single leaf was left on the trees and plants throughout the land of Egypt."},{"number":16,"verse":"Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron. “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you,” he confessed."},{"number":17,"verse":"“Forgive my sin, just this once, and plead with the LORD your God to take away this death from me.”"},{"number":18,"verse":"So Moses left Pharaoh’s court and pleaded with the LORD."},{"number":19,"verse":"The LORD responded by shifting the wind, and the strong west wind blew the locusts into the Red Sea.
