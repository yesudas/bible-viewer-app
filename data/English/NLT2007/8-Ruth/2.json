And as it happened, she found herself working in a field that belonged to Boaz, the relative of her father-in-law, Elimelech."},{"number":4,"verse":"While she was there, Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters. “The LORD be with you!” he said. “The LORD bless you!” the harvesters replied."},{"number":5,"verse":"Then Boaz asked his foreman, “Who is that young woman over there?

She has been hard at work ever since, except for a few minutes’ rest in the shelter.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"Boaz went over and said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Stay right here with us when you gather grain; don’t go to any other fields. Stay right behind the young women working in my field."},{"number":9,"verse":"See which part of the field they are harvesting, and then follow them.

Let her pick them up, and don’t give her a hard time!”"},{"number":17,"verse":"So Ruth gathered barley there all day, and when she beat out the grain that evening, it filled an entire basket.

Stay with his young women right through the whole harvest. You might be harassed in other fields, but you’ll be safe with him.”"},{"number":23,"verse":"So Ruth worked alongside the women in Boaz’s fields and gathered grain with them until the end of the barley harvest. Then she continued working with them through the wheat harvest in early summer. And all the while she lived with her mother-in-law."}]}
