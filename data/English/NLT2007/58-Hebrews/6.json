Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don’t need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from evil deeds (Greek from dead works.) and placing our faith in God."},{"number":2,"verse":"You don’t need further instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment."},{"number":3,"verse":"And so, God willing, we will move forward to further understanding."},{"number":4,"verse":"For it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened—those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit,"},{"number":5,"verse":"who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come—"},{"number":6,"verse":"and who then turn away from God. It is impossible to bring such people back to repentance; by rejecting the Son of God, they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame."},{"number":7,"verse":"When the ground soaks up the falling rain and bears a good crop for the farmer, it has God’s blessing."},{"number":8,"verse":"But if a field bears thorns and thistles, it is useless. The farmer will soon condemn that field and burn it."},{"number":9,"verse":"Dear friends, even though we are talking this way, we really don’t believe it applies to you. We are confident that you are meant for better things, things that come with salvation."},{"number":10,"verse":"For God is not unjust.

Instead, you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God’s promises because of their faith and endurance."},{"number":13,"verse":"God’s Promises Bring Hope For example, there was God’s promise to Abraham. Since there was no one greater to swear by, God took an oath in his own name, saying:"},{"number":14,"verse":"“I will certainly bless you, and I will multiply your descendants beyond number.” (Gen 22:17.)"},{"number":15,"verse":"Then Abraham waited patiently, and he received what God had promised."},{"number":16,"verse":"Now when people take an oath, they call on someone greater than themselves to hold them to it. And without any question that oath is binding."},{"number":17,"verse":"God also bound himself with an oath, so that those who received the promise could be perfectly sure that he would never change his mind."},{"number":18,"verse":"So God has given both his promise and his oath. These two things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can have great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us."},{"number":19,"verse":"This hope is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads us through the curtain into God’s inner sanctuary."},{"number":20,"verse":"Jesus has already gone in there for us. He has become our eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek."}]}
