But it did them no good because they didn’t share the faith of those who listened to God. (Some manuscripts read they didn’t combine what they heard with faith.)"},{"number":3,"verse":"For only we who believe can enter his rest. As for the others, God said, “In my anger I took an oath: ‘They will never enter my place of rest,’” (Ps 95:11.) even though this rest has been ready since he made the world."},{"number":4,"verse":"We know it is ready because of the place in the Scriptures where it mentions the seventh day: “On the seventh day God rested from all his work.” (Gen 2:2.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"But in the other passage God said, “They will never enter my place of rest.” (Ps 95:11.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"So God’s rest is there for people to enter, but those who first heard this good news failed to enter because they disobeyed God."},{"number":7,"verse":"So God set another time for entering his rest, and that time is today.

But if we disobey God, as the people of Israel did, we will fall."},{"number":12,"verse":"For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires."},{"number":13,"verse":"Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes, and he is the one to whom we are accountable."},{"number":14,"verse":"(Christ Is Our High Priest) So then, since we have a great High Priest who has entered heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we believe."},{"number":15,"verse":"This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do, yet he did not sin."},{"number":16,"verse":"So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God.
