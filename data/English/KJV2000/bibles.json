{"bibles":[{"id":1,"isDefault":false,"info":{"abbr":"KJV2000","commonName":"King James Version 2000","shortName":"KJV 2000","longName":"King James Version 2000","longEnglishName":"King James Version 2000","languageCode":"en","publishedYear":"2000","publishedBy":"Robert A. Couric","translatedBy":"Robert A. Couric, Th.D. (1929-2011). The intent of King James 2000 is to keep every KJV word the same, unless a misunderstanding or a gross word order “error” (in today’s usage) must be averted. All punctuation is left the same, including omission of quotation marks, in order to keep the rhythm and pattern of KJV memorization intact. Even the interpolative KJV words (normally in italics) are kept the same if possible. No “corrections” or “textual considerations” are taken into account, since the King James 2000 intent is to preserve the KJV “as is,” except for truly necessary changes. Pronouns addressing Deity are not set apart by capitalization, but are kept just as found in the KJV, with lower case letters (neither is distinction made in the original languages). The King James 2000 will provide a version which has been, to some extent, verbally composed already. Many pastors and other Bible readers have already exchanged show for shew, you for ye, and know for wot in their private and public readings. Some of these “corrections” have already appeared in the various KJV printings. The King James 2000 will make these common exchanges “official.” Since completing the King James 2000 New Testament in 1993, the editor has finally completed the Old Testament. The comments in the New Testament preface apply also to the Old Testament, with the following two exceptions: (1) The statement that the King James 2000 is not a new version may not hold true to some readers. This will depend on the reader’s definition as to what constitutes a new version. The intent of the King James 2000 Bible remains the same, that a very minimum necessary change will be made to the KJV to make it readable and understandable. (2) The red letter editions put the words of Deity in red throughout the Bible, both Old Testament and New Testament. The New Testament includes not only the words of Jesus in red, but also the words of the Father, the Holy Spirit, and appropriate quotations from the Old Testament. This particular red letter edition is, to my knowledge, unique in the history of Bible editions. The completion of the King James 2000 has been a monumental, time-consuming effort, and only the absolute grace of God has provided the editor the health and strength and perseverance to accomplish this task.","copyRight":"Public
