This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God."},{"number":25,"verse":"For who can eat, or who else can have enjoyment, more than I?"},{"number":26,"verse":"For God gives to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he gives the work of gathering and heaping up, only that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and grasping of the wind."}]}
