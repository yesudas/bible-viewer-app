Shall we sin (1 Cor. 9:21) because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not!"},{"number":2,"verse":"Do you not know that (Prov. 5:22; (Matt. 6:24); John 8:34; 2 Pet. 2:19) to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one’s slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?"},{"number":3,"verse":"But God be thanked that though you were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart (2 Tim. 1:13) that form of doctrine to which you were delivered."},{"number":4,"verse":"And (John 8:32; Rom. 6:22; 8:2; 1 Cor. 7:22; Gal. 5:1; 1 Pet. 2:16) having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness."},{"number":5,"verse":"I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves of uncleanness, and of lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves of righteousness for holiness."},{"number":6,"verse":"For when you were (John 8:34) slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness."},{"number":7,"verse":"(Jer. 12:13; Ezek. 16:63; Rom. 7:5) What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed?

But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband."},{"number":12,"verse":"So then ((Matt. 5:32)) if, while her husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she has married another man."},{"number":13,"verse":"Therefore, my brethren, you also have become (Rom. 8:2; Gal. 2:19; 5:18; (Col. 2:14)) dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another—to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should (Gal. 5:22) bear fruit to God."},{"number":14,"verse":"For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were aroused by the law (Rom. 6:13) were at work in our members (Rom. 6:21; Gal. 5:19; James 1:15) to bear fruit to death."},{"number":15,"verse":"But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve (Rom. 2:29; 2 Cor. 3:6) in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter."},{"number":16,"verse":"Sin’s Advantage in the Law What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, (Rom. 3:20) I would not have known sin except through the law.
