If we are not given grain, let us take it!"},{"number":3,"verse":"Also some said, We are mortgaging our lands, vineyards, and houses to buy grain because of the scarcity."},{"number":4,"verse":"Others said, We have borrowed money on our fields and vineyards to pay the [Persian] king's heavy tax."},{"number":5,"verse":"Although our flesh is the same as that of our brethren and our children are as theirs, yet we are forced to sell our children as slaves; some of our daughters have already been thus sold, and we are powerless to redeem them, for others have our lands and vineyards."},{"number":6,"verse":"I [Nehemiah] was very angry when I heard their cry and these words."},{"number":7,"verse":"I thought it over and then rebuked the nobles and officials. I told them, You are exacting interest from your own kinsmen. And I held a great assembly against them."},{"number":8,"verse":"I said to them, We, according to our ability, have bought back our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations; but will you even sell your brethren, that they may be sold to us?
