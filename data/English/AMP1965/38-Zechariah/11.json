Wail, O you oaks of Bashan, for the thick and inaccessible forest [on the steep mountainside] has in flames been felled!"},{"number":3,"verse":"A voice of the wailing of the shepherds, for their glory, the broad pasturage, is laid waste! A voice of the roaring of young lions, for the pride of the Jordan [the jungle or thickets] is ruined!"},{"number":4,"verse":"Thus says the Lord my God: Shepherd the flock [destined] for slaughter,"},{"number":5,"verse":"Whose buyers or possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty; and they who sell them say, Blessed be the Lord, for I have become rich! And their own shepherds neither pity nor spare them [from the wolves]."},{"number":6,"verse":"For I will no more pity or spare the inhabitants of the land, says the Lord; but behold, I will deliver every man into his neighbor's hand and into the hand of his [foreign] king. And [the enemy] shall lay waste the land, and I will not deliver [the people] out of the hand [of the foreign oppressor]."},{"number":7,"verse":"So I [Zechariah] shepherded the flock of slaughter, truly [as the name implies] the most miserable of sheep.

So they weighed out for my price thirty pieces of silver."},{"number":13,"verse":"And the Lord said to me, Cast it to the potter [as if He said, To the dogs!]--the munificently [miserable] sum at which I [and My shepherd] am priced by them!

The sword shall smite his arm and his right eye; his arm shall be utterly withered and his right eye utterly blinded. [Jer. 23:1; John 10:12, 13.]"}]}
