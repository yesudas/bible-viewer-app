Father!"},{"number":7,"verse":"Therefore, you are no longer a slave (bond servant) but a son; and if a son, then [it follows that you are] an heir by the aid of God, through Christ."},{"number":8,"verse":"But at that previous time, when you had not come to be acquainted with and understand and know the true God, you [Gentiles] were in bondage to gods who by their very nature could not be gods at all [gods that really did not exist]."},{"number":9,"verse":"Now, however, that you have come to be acquainted with and understand and know [the true] God, or rather to be understood and known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly and worthless elementary things [of all religions before Christ came], whose slaves you once more want to become?"},{"number":10,"verse":"You observe [particular] days and months and seasons and years!"},{"number":11,"verse":"I am alarmed [about you], lest I have labored among and over you to no purpose and in vain."},{"number":12,"verse":"Brethren, I beg of you, become as I am [free from the bondage of Jewish ritualism and ordinances], for I also have become as you are [a Gentile].
