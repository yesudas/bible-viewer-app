Others said, He seems to be an announcer of foreign deities--because he preached Jesus and the resurrection."},{"number":19,"verse":"And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus [Mars Hill meeting place], saying, May we know what this novel (unheard of and unprecedented) teaching is which you are openly declaring?"},{"number":20,"verse":"For you set forth some startling things, foreign and strange to our ears; we wish to know therefore just what these things mean--"},{"number":21,"verse":"For the Athenians, all of them, and the foreign residents and visitors among them spent all their leisure time in nothing except telling or hearing something newer than the last--"},{"number":22,"verse":"So Paul, standing in the center of the Areopagus [Mars Hill meeting place], said: Men of Athens, I perceive in every way [on every hand and with every turn I make] that you are most religious or very reverent to demons."},{"number":23,"verse":"For as I passed along and carefully observed your objects of worship, I came also upon an altar with this inscription, To the unknown god.
