For there is no authority except from God [by His permission, His sanction], and those that exist do so by God's appointment.

And those who resist will bring down judgment upon themselves [receiving the penalty due them]."},{"number":3,"verse":"For civil authorities are not a terror to [people of] good conduct, but to [those of] bad behavior. Would you have no dread of him who is in authority? Then do what is right and you will receive his approval and commendation."},{"number":4,"verse":"For he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, [you should dread him and] be afraid, for he does not bear and wear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant to execute His wrath (punishment, vengeance) on the wrongdoer."},{"number":5,"verse":"Therefore one must be subject, not only to avoid God's wrath and escape punishment, but also as a matter of principle and for the sake of conscience."},{"number":6,"verse":"For this same reason you pay taxes, for [the civil authorities] are official servants under God, devoting themselves to attending to this very service."},{"number":7,"verse":"Render to all men their dues. [Pay] taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, and honor to whom honor is due."},{"number":8,"verse":"Keep out of debt and owe no man anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor [who practices loving others] has fulfilled the Law [relating to one's fellowmen, meeting all its requirements]."},{"number":9,"verse":"The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet (have an evil desire), and any other commandment, are summed up in the single command, You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself.
