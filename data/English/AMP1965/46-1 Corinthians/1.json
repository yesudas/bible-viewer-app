Was Paul crucified on behalf of you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?"},{"number":14,"verse":"I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,"},{"number":15,"verse":"Lest anyone should say that I baptized in my own name."},{"number":16,"verse":"[Yes] I did baptize the household of Stephanas also. More than these, I do not remember that I baptized anyone."},{"number":17,"verse":"For Christ (the Messiah) sent me out not to baptize but [to evangelize by] preaching the glad tidings (the Gospel), and that not with verbal eloquence, lest the cross of Christ should be deprived of force and emptied of its power and rendered vain (fruitless, void of value, and of no effect)."},{"number":18,"verse":"For the story and message of the cross is sheer absurdity and folly to those who are perishing and on their way to perdition, but to us who are being saved it is the [manifestation of] the power of God."},{"number":19,"verse":"For it is written, I will baffle and render useless and destroy the learning of the learned and the philosophy of the philosophers and the cleverness of the clever and the discernment of the discerning; I will frustrate and nullify [them] and bring [them] to nothing. [Isa. 29:14.]"},{"number":20,"verse":"Where is the wise man (the philosopher)? Where is the scribe (the scholar)? Where is the investigator (the logician, the debater) of this present time and age? Has not God shown up the nonsense and the folly of this world's wisdom?"},{"number":21,"verse":"For when the world with all its earthly wisdom failed to perceive and recognize and know God by means of its own philosophy, God in His wisdom was pleased through the foolishness of preaching [salvation, procured by Christ and to be had through Him], to save those who believed (who clung to and trusted in and relied on Him)."},{"number":22,"verse":"For while Jews [demandingly] ask for signs and miracles and Greeks pursue philosophy and wisdom,"},{"number":23,"verse":"We preach Christ (the Messiah) crucified, [preaching which] to the Jews is a scandal and an offensive stumbling block [that springs a snare or trap], and to the Gentiles it is absurd and utterly unphilosophical nonsense."},{"number":24,"verse":"But to those who are called, whether Jew or Greek (Gentile), Christ [is] the Power of God and the Wisdom of God."},{"number":25,"verse":"[This is] because the foolish thing [that has its source in] God is wiser than men, and the weak thing [that springs] from God is stronger than men."},{"number":26,"verse":"For [simply] consider your own call, brethren; not many [of you were considered to be] wise according to human estimates and standards, not many influential and powerful, not many of high and noble birth."},{"number":27,"verse":"[No] for God selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is foolish to put the wise to shame, and what the world calls weak to put the strong to shame."},{"number":28,"verse":"And God also selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is lowborn and insignificant and branded and treated with contempt, even the things that are nothing, that He might depose and bring to nothing the things that are,"},{"number":29,"verse":"So that no mortal man should [have pretense for glorying and] boast in the presence of God."},{"number":30,"verse":"But it is from Him that you have your life in Christ Jesus, Whom God made our Wisdom from God, [revealed to us a knowledge of the divine plan of salvation previously hidden, manifesting itself as] our Righteousness [thus making us upright and putting us in right standing with God], and our Consecration [making us pure and holy], and our Redemption [providing our ransom from eternal penalty for sin]."},{"number":31,"verse":"So then, as it is written, Let him who boasts and proudly rejoices and glories, boast and proudly rejoice and glory in the Lord.
