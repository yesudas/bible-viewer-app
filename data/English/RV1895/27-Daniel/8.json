now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai."},{"number":3,"verse":"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last."},{"number":4,"verse":"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself."},{"number":5,"verse":"And as I was considering, behold, an he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes."},{"number":6,"verse":"And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power."},{"number":7,"verse":"And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns;

and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them."},{"number":11,"verse":"Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down."},{"number":12,"verse":"And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered."},{"number":13,"verse":"Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the continual burnt offering, and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?"},{"number":14,"verse":"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."},{"number":15,"verse":"And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man."},{"number":16,"verse":"And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision."},{"number":17,"verse":"So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end."},{"number":18,"verse":"Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright."},{"number":19,"verse":"And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation: for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end."},{"number":20,"verse":"The ram which thou sawest that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia."},{"number":21,"verse":"And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king."},{"number":22,"verse":"And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power."},{"number":23,"verse":"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up."},{"number":24,"verse":"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do his pleasure: and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people."},{"number":25,"verse":"And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in their security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand."},{"number":26,"verse":"And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come."},{"number":27,"verse":"And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king's business: and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it."}]}
