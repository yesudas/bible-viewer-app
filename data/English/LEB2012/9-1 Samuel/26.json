So then, please let me pin him to the ground with the spear one time, and I will not strike him twice.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him!

And who is like you in Israel? Why did you not keep watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy your lord the king."},{"number":16,"verse":"This thing that you have done is not good.
