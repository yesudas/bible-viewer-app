But Ephraim will return to Egypt, and in Assyria they will eat unclean food."},{"number":4,"verse":"They will not pour drink offerings of wine to Yahweh, and their sacrifices will not please him.

Nettles will possess their precious things of silver; thorns will be in their tents."},{"number":7,"verse":"The days of punishment have come; the days of retribution have come; Israel knows! The prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is acting like a madman.

Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts."},{"number":15,"verse":"Every evil of theirs began at Gilgal, so I began to hate them there; because of the evil of their deeds I will drive them out from my house. I will love them no more; all their officials are rebels."},{"number":16,"verse":"Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, they shall not bear fruit. Even if they give birth, I will kill the cherished offspring of their womb."},{"number":17,"verse":"My God will reject them because they did not listen to him, and they will be wanderers among the nations."}]}
