It does not say, “and to descendants,” as concerning many, but as concerning one, “and to your descendant,” who is Christ."},{"number":17,"verse":"Now I am saying this: the law, that came after four hundred and thirty years, does not revoke a covenant previously ratified by God, in order to nullify the promise."},{"number":18,"verse":"For if the inheritance is from the law, it is no longer from the promise, but God graciously gave it to Abraham through the promise."},{"number":19,"verse":"The Addition of the Law Why then the law?
