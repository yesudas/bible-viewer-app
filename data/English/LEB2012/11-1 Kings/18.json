Perhaps we may find green grass that we may keep horses and mules alive and that we might not lose any of the animals.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"So they divided the land for themselves in order to pass through it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself."},{"number":7,"verse":"It happened that Obadiah was on the way, and suddenly Elijah was there to meet him.

I will prepare the other bull and set it on the wood, but I will put no fire on it."},{"number":24,"verse":"Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh, and it shall be that the god who answers by fire, he is God.” Then all the people answered and said, “The word is good!”"},{"number":25,"verse":"Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are the majority, and call on the name of your god, but don’t set fire under it.”"},{"number":26,"verse":"So they took the bull that he allowed to them, prepared it, and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice and there was no answer, so they limped about the altar which they had made."},{"number":27,"verse":"It happened at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, “Call out with a loud voice, for he is a god! Perhaps he is meditating, or is using the bathroom, or is on a journey. Perhaps he is asleep and must wake up!”"},{"number":28,"verse":"So they called out with a loud voice, and they cut themselves with swords and with spears as was their custom, until the blood poured out over them."},{"number":29,"verse":"It happened as noon passed, they raged until the time of the evening offering, but there was no voice, there was no answer, and no one paid attention."},{"number":30,"verse":"Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me,” so all the people came closer to him.

Then he said, “Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.”"},{"number":34,"verse":"He said, “Do it again!” They did it again.

Yahweh, he is God!”"},{"number":40,"verse":"Then Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; don’t let any man of them escape!” So they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the wadi of Kishon and killed them there."},{"number":41,"verse":"Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of the noise of rain.”"},{"number":42,"verse":"So Ahab went up to eat and to drink while Elijah went to the top of Carmel, bent down to the earth, and put his face between his knees."},{"number":43,"verse":"Then he said to his servant, “Please go and look in the direction of the sea.” So he went up and looked; then he said, “There is nothing.” Then he said, “Go back,” seven times."},{"number":44,"verse":"It happened that at the seventh time, he said, “Look, there is a small cloud, as the hand of a man, coming up from the sea.” Then Elijah said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Harness your horses and go down, lest the rain stop you.’”"},{"number":45,"verse":"In no time the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was heavy rain.
