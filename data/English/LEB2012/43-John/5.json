But while I am coming, another goes down before me.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk!”"},{"number":9,"verse":"And immediately the man became well and picked up his mat and began to walk.

For whatever that one does, these things also the Son does likewise."},{"number":20,"verse":"For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing.
