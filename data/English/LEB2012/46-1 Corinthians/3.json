But now you are still not able,"},{"number":3,"verse":"for you are still fleshly. For where there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and do you not live like unregenerate people?"},{"number":4,"verse":"For whenever anyone says, “I am with Paul,” and another, “I am with Apollos,” are you not merely human?"},{"number":5,"verse":"Therefore, what is Apollos and what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave."},{"number":6,"verse":"I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing it to grow."},{"number":7,"verse":"So then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who is causing it to grow."},{"number":8,"verse":"Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one, but each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor."},{"number":9,"verse":"For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building."},{"number":10,"verse":"According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building upon it.
