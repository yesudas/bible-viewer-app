The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, in order that the church may receive edification."},{"number":6,"verse":"But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, how do I benefit you, unless I speak to you either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching?"},{"number":7,"verse":"Likewise, the inanimate things which produce a sound, whether flute or lyre, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the lyre?"},{"number":8,"verse":"For indeed, if the trumpet produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare for battle?"},{"number":9,"verse":"And so you through the tongue, unless you produce a clear message, how will it be known what is spoken?

I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will also sing praise with my mind."},{"number":16,"verse":"For otherwise, if you praise in your spirit, how will the one who fills the place of the outsider say the “amen” at your thanksgiving, because he does not know what you are saying?"},{"number":17,"verse":"For indeed you are giving thanks well, but the other person is not edified."},{"number":18,"verse":"I give thanks to God that I speak with tongues more than all of you,"},{"number":19,"verse":"but in the church I prefer to speak five words with my mind, in order that I may instruct other people, than ten thousand words in a tongue."},{"number":20,"verse":"Brothers, do not become children in your understanding, but with respect to wickedness be as a child, and in your understanding be mature."},{"number":21,"verse":"In the law it is written: “By those who speak a foreign language and by the lips of others I will speak to this people, and not even in this way will they obey me,” says the Lord."},{"number":22,"verse":"So then, tongues are for a sign not to those who believe, but to unbelievers, but prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for those who believe."},{"number":23,"verse":"Therefore, if the whole church comes together at the same time and all speak with tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds?"},{"number":24,"verse":"But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all,"},{"number":25,"verse":"the secret things of his heart become evident, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among you!”"},{"number":26,"verse":"Specific Instructions for Orderly Worship Services Therefore what should you do , brothers? Whenever you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.
