Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go back to Pharaoh and announce to him, ‘This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so they can worship me."},{"number":2,"verse":"If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs across your entire land."},{"number":3,"verse":"The Nile River will swarm with frogs. They will come up out of the river and into your palace, even into your bedroom and onto your bed! They will enter the houses of your officials and your people. They will even jump into your ovens and your kneading bowls."},{"number":4,"verse":"Frogs will jump on you, your people, and all your officials.’”"},{"number":5,"verse":"(Verses 8:5-32 are numbered 8:1-28 in Hebrew text.) Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Raise the staff in your hand over all the rivers, canals, and ponds of Egypt, and bring up frogs over all the land.’”"},{"number":6,"verse":"So Aaron raised his hand over the waters of Egypt, and frogs came up and covered the whole land!"},{"number":7,"verse":"But the magicians were able to do the same thing with their magic. They, too, caused frogs to come up on the land of Egypt."},{"number":8,"verse":"Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and begged, “Plead with the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people. I will let your people go, so they can offer sacrifices to the LORD.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"“You set the time!” Moses replied. “Tell me when you want me to pray for you, your officials, and your people. Then you and your houses will be rid of the frogs. They will remain only in the Nile River.”"},{"number":10,"verse":"“Do it tomorrow,” Pharaoh said. “All right,” Moses replied, “it will be as you have said. Then you will know that there is no one like the LORD our God."},{"number":11,"verse":"The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials, and your people.

Go ahead and offer sacrifices to your God,” he said. “But do it here in this land.”"},{"number":26,"verse":"But Moses replied, “That wouldn’t be right. The Egyptians detest the sacrifices that we offer to the LORD our God. Look, if we offer our sacrifices here where the Egyptians can see us, they will stone us."},{"number":27,"verse":"We must take a three-day trip into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, just as he has commanded us.”"},{"number":28,"verse":"“All right, go ahead,” Pharaoh replied. “I will let you go into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God. But don’t go too far away. Now hurry and pray for me.”"},{"number":29,"verse":"Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the swarms of flies will disappear from you and your officials and all your people.
