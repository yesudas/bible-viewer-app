See note on 35:21.) moaned. “Why did you tell him you had another brother?”"},{"number":7,"verse":"“The man kept asking us questions about our family,” they replied. “He asked, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ So we answered his questions. How could we know he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?”"},{"number":8,"verse":"Judah said to his father, “Send the boy with me, and we will be on our way.

They finally arrived in Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph."},{"number":16,"verse":"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the manager of his household, “These men will eat with me this noon.

He gave them water to wash their feet and provided food for their donkeys."},{"number":25,"verse":"They were told they would be eating there, so they prepared their gifts for Joseph’s arrival at noon."},{"number":26,"verse":"When Joseph came home, they gave him the gifts they had brought him, then bowed low to the ground before him."},{"number":27,"verse":"After greeting them, he asked, “How is your father, the old man you spoke about? Is he still alive?”"},{"number":28,"verse":"“Yes,” they replied. “Our father, your servant, is alive and well.” And they bowed low again."},{"number":29,"verse":"Then Joseph looked at his brother Benjamin, the son of his own mother. “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” Joseph asked. “May God be gracious to you, my son.”"},{"number":30,"verse":"Then Joseph hurried from the room because he was overcome with emotion for his brother. He went into his private room, where he broke down and wept."},{"number":31,"verse":"After washing his face, he came back out, keeping himself under control. Then he ordered, “Bring out the food!”"},{"number":32,"verse":"The waiters served Joseph at his own table, and his brothers were served at a separate table. The Egyptians who ate with Joseph sat at their own table, because Egyptians despise Hebrews and refuse to eat with them."},{"number":33,"verse":"Joseph told each of his brothers where to sit, and to their amazement, he seated them according to age, from oldest to youngest."},{"number":34,"verse":"And Joseph filled their plates with food from his own table, giving Benjamin five times as much as he gave the others.
