(Hebrew What sorrow awaits the crowning glory of the drunks of Ephraim, referring to Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom of Israel.) It sits at the head of a fertile valley, but its glorious beauty will fade like a flower.

The coming destruction can never touch us, for we have built a strong refuge made of lies and deception.”"},{"number":16,"verse":"Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “Look! I am placing a foundation stone in Jerusalem, (Hebrew in Zion.) a firm and tested stone. It is a precious cornerstone that is safe to build on. Whoever believes need never be shaken. (Greek version reads Look! I am placing a stone in the foundation of Jerusalem [literally Zion], / a precious cornerstone for its foundation, chosen for great honor. / Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced. Compare Rom 9:33; 1 Pet 2:6.)"},{"number":17,"verse":"I will test you with the measuring line of justice and the plumb line of righteousness. Since your refuge is made of lies, a hailstorm will knock it down.

The blankets are too narrow to cover you."},{"number":21,"verse":"The LORD will come as he did against the Philistines at Mount Perazim and against the Amorites at Gibeon.

A threshing wheel is never rolled on cumin; instead, it is beaten lightly with a flail."},{"number":28,"verse":"Grain for bread is easily crushed, so he doesn’t keep on pounding it. He threshes it under the wheels of a cart, but he doesn’t pulverize it."},{"number":29,"verse":"The LORD of Heaven’s Armies is a wonderful teacher, and he gives the farmer great wisdom."}]}
