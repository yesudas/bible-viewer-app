{"bibleAbbr":"NLT2015","bookName":"Jeremiah","bookEnglishName":"Jeremiah","chapterNumber":9,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"(Verse 9:1 is numbered 8:23 in Hebrew text.) If only my head were a pool of water and my eyes a fountain of tears, I would weep day and night for all my people who have been slaughtered."},{"number":2,"verse":"(Verses 9:2-26 are numbered 9:1-25 in Hebrew text.) Oh, that I could go away and forget my people and live in a travelers’ shack in the desert. For they are all adulterers— a pack of treacherous liars."},{"number":3,"verse":"(Judgment for Disobedience) “My people bend their tongues like bows to shoot out lies. They refuse to stand up for the truth. They only go from bad to worse. They do not know me,” says the LORD."},{"number":4,"verse":"“Beware of your neighbor! Don’t even trust your brother!

I, the LORD, have spoken!"},{"number":25,"verse":"“A time is coming,” says the LORD, “when I will punish all those who are circumcised in body but not in spirit—"},{"number":26,"verse":"the Egyptians, Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites, the people who live in the desert in remote places, (Or in the desert and clip the corners of their hair.) and yes, even the people of Judah. And like all these pagan nations, the people of Israel also have uncircumcised hearts.”"}]}
