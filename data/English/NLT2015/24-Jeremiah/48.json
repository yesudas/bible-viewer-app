The city of Kiriathaim will be humiliated and captured; the fortress will be humiliated and broken down."},{"number":2,"verse":"No one will ever brag about Moab again, for in Heshbon there is a plot to destroy her. ‘Come,’ they say, ‘we will cut her off from being a nation.’ The town of Madmen, (Madmen sounds like the Hebrew word for “silence”; it should not be confused with the English word madmen.) too, will be silenced; the sword will follow you there."},{"number":3,"verse":"Listen to the cries from Horonaim, cries of devastation and great destruction."},{"number":4,"verse":"All Moab is destroyed. Her little ones will cry out. (Greek version reads Her cries are heard as far away as Zoar.)"},{"number":5,"verse":"Her refugees weep bitterly, climbing the slope to Luhith. They cry out in terror, descending the slope to Horonaim."},{"number":6,"verse":"Flee for your lives! Hide (Or Hide like a wild donkey; or Hide like a juniper shrub; or Be like [the town of] Aroer.

He is like wine that has been allowed to settle. He has not been poured from flask to flask, and he is now fragrant and smooth."},{"number":12,"verse":"But the time is coming soon,” says the LORD, “when I will send men to pour him from his jar. They will pour him out, then shatter the jar!"},{"number":13,"verse":"At last Moab will be ashamed of his idol Chemosh, as the people of Israel were ashamed of their gold calf at Bethel. (Hebrew ashamed when they trusted in Bethel.)"},{"number":14,"verse":"“You used to boast, ‘We are heroes, mighty men of war.’"},{"number":15,"verse":"But now Moab and his towns will be destroyed.

Tell it by the banks of the Arnon River: Moab has been destroyed!’"},{"number":21,"verse":"Judgment has been poured out on the towns of the plateau— on Holon and Jahaz (Hebrew Jahzah, a variant spelling of Jahaz.) and Mephaath,"},{"number":22,"verse":"on Dibon and Nebo and Beth-diblathaim,"},{"number":23,"verse":"on Kiriathaim and Beth-gamul and Beth-meon,"},{"number":24,"verse":"on Kerioth and Bozrah— all the towns of Moab, far and near."},{"number":25,"verse":"“The strength of Moab has ended. His arm has been broken,” says the LORD."},{"number":26,"verse":"“Let him stagger and fall like a drunkard, for he has rebelled against the LORD.

(Hebrew Kir-heres, a variant spelling of Kir-hareseth; also in 48:36.)"},{"number":32,"verse":"“You people of Sibmah, rich in vineyards, I will weep for you even more than I did for Jazer. Your spreading vines once reached as far as the Dead Sea, (Hebrew the sea of Jazer.) but the destroyer has stripped you bare! He has harvested your grapes and summer fruits."},{"number":33,"verse":"Joy and gladness are gone from fruitful Moab. The presses yield no wine. No one treads the grapes with shouts of joy. There is shouting, yes, but not of joy."},{"number":34,"verse":"“Instead, their awful cries of terror can be heard from Heshbon clear across to Elealeh and Jahaz; from Zoar all the way to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah.
