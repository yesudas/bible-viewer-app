But in spite of this there is hope for Israel."},{"number":3,"verse":"Let us now make a covenant with our God to divorce our pagan wives and to send them away with their children.

By marrying pagan women, you have increased Israel’s guilt."},{"number":11,"verse":"So now confess your sin to the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and do what he demands. Separate yourselves from the people of the land and from these pagan women.”"},{"number":12,"verse":"Then the whole assembly raised their voices and answered, “Yes, you are right; we must do as you say!”"},{"number":13,"verse":"Then they added, “This isn’t something that can be done in a day or two, for many of us are involved in this extremely sinful affair.
