He made you holy by means of Christ Jesus, (Or because you belong to Christ Jesus.) just as he did for all people everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours."},{"number":3,"verse":"May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace."},{"number":4,"verse":"(Paul Gives Thanks to God) I always thank my God for you and for the gracious gifts he has given you, now that you belong to Christ Jesus."},{"number":5,"verse":"Through him, God has enriched your church in every way—with all of your eloquent words and all of your knowledge."},{"number":6,"verse":"This confirms that what I told you about Christ is true."},{"number":7,"verse":"Now you have every spiritual gift you need as you eagerly wait for the return of our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"number":8,"verse":"He will keep you strong to the end so that you will be free from all blame on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ returns."},{"number":9,"verse":"God will do this, for he is faithful to do what he says, and he has invited you into partnership with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."},{"number":10,"verse":"(Divisions in the Church) I appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, (Greek brothers; also in 1:11, 26.) by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, to live in harmony with each other.
