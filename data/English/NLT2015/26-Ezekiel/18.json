Such people will not die."},{"number":29,"verse":"And yet the people of Israel keep saying, ‘The Lord isn’t doing what’s right!’ O people of Israel, it is you who are not doing what’s right, not I."},{"number":30,"verse":"“Therefore, I will judge each of you, O people of Israel, according to your actions, says the Sovereign LORD.
