How have I offended your father that he is so determined to kill me?”"},{"number":2,"verse":"“That’s not true!” Jonathan protested. “You’re not going to die. He always tells me everything he’s going to do, even the little things. I know my father wouldn’t hide something like this from me. It just isn’t so!”"},{"number":3,"verse":"Then David took an oath before Jonathan and said, “Your father knows perfectly well about our friendship, so he has said to himself, ‘I won’t tell Jonathan—why should I hurt him?’ But I swear to you that I am only a step away from death! I swear it by the LORD and by your own soul!”"},{"number":4,"verse":"“Tell me what I can do to help you,” Jonathan exclaimed."},{"number":5,"verse":"David replied, “Tomorrow we celebrate the new moon festival.

My brother demanded that I be there. So please let me get away to see my brothers.’ That’s why he isn’t here at the king’s table.”"},{"number":30,"verse":"Saul boiled with rage at Jonathan. “You stupid son of a whore!” (Hebrew You son of a perverse and rebellious woman.) he swore at him. “Do you think I don’t know that you want him to be king in your place, shaming yourself and your mother?"},{"number":31,"verse":"As long as that son of Jesse is alive, you’ll never be king. Now go and get him so I can kill him!”"},{"number":32,"verse":"“But why should he be put to death?” Jonathan asked his father. “What has he done?”"},{"number":33,"verse":"Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan, intending to kill him.
