These seven nations are greater and more numerous than you."},{"number":2,"verse":"When the LORD your God hands these nations over to you and you conquer them, you must completely destroy (The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in 7:26.) them. Make no treaties with them and show them no mercy."},{"number":3,"verse":"You must not intermarry with them. Do not let your daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters,"},{"number":4,"verse":"for they will lead your children away from me to worship other gods. Then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and he will quickly destroy you."},{"number":5,"verse":"This is what you must do. You must break down their pagan altars and shatter their sacred pillars. Cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols."},{"number":6,"verse":"For you are a holy people, who belong to the LORD your God. Of all the people on earth, the LORD your God has chosen you to be his own special treasure."},{"number":7,"verse":"“The LORD did not set his heart on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other nations, for you were the smallest of all nations!"},{"number":8,"verse":"Rather, it was simply that the LORD loves you, and he was keeping the oath he had sworn to your ancestors. That is why the LORD rescued you with such a strong hand from your slavery and from the oppressive hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt."},{"number":9,"verse":"Understand, therefore, that the LORD your God is indeed God. He is the faithful God who keeps his covenant for a thousand generations and lavishes his unfailing love on those who love him and obey his commands."},{"number":10,"verse":"But he does not hesitate to punish and destroy those who reject him."},{"number":11,"verse":"Therefore, you must obey all these commands, decrees, and regulations I am giving you today."},{"number":12,"verse":"“If you listen to these regulations and faithfully obey them, the LORD your God will keep his covenant of unfailing love with you, as he promised with an oath to your ancestors."},{"number":13,"verse":"He will love you and bless you, and he will give you many children.

None of your men or women will be childless, and all your livestock will bear young."},{"number":15,"verse":"And the LORD will protect you from all sickness. He will not let you suffer from the terrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all your enemies!"},{"number":16,"verse":"“You must destroy all the nations the LORD your God hands over to you. Show them no mercy, and do not worship their gods, or they will trap you."},{"number":17,"verse":"Perhaps you will think to yourselves, ‘How can we ever conquer these nations that are so much more powerful than we are?’"},{"number":18,"verse":"But don’t be afraid of them! Just remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all the land of Egypt."},{"number":19,"verse":"Remember the great terrors the LORD your God sent against them. You saw it all with your own eyes! And remember the miraculous signs and wonders, and the strong hand and powerful arm with which he brought you out of Egypt. The LORD your God will use this same power against all the people you fear."},{"number":20,"verse":"And then the LORD your God will send terror (Often rendered the hornet.

He will throw them into complete confusion until they are destroyed."},{"number":24,"verse":"He will put their kings in your power, and you will erase their names from the face of the earth. No one will be able to stand against you, and you will destroy them all."},{"number":25,"verse":"“You must burn their idols in fire, and you must not covet the silver or gold that covers them. You must not take it or it will become a trap to you, for it is detestable to the LORD your God."},{"number":26,"verse":"Do not bring any detestable objects into your home, for then you will be destroyed, just like them. You must utterly detest such things, for they are set apart for destruction."}]}
