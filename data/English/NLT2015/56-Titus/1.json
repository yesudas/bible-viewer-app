May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace."},{"number":5,"verse":"(Titus’s Work in Crete) I left you on the island of Crete so you could complete our work there and appoint elders in each town as I instructed you."},{"number":6,"verse":"An elder must live a blameless life. He must be faithful to his wife, (Or must have only one wife, or must be married only once; Greek reads must be the husband of one wife.) and his children must be believers who don’t have a reputation for being wild or rebellious."},{"number":7,"verse":"A church leader (Or An overseer, or A bishop.) is a manager of God’s household, so he must live a blameless life.

So reprimand them sternly to make them strong in the faith."},{"number":14,"verse":"They must stop listening to Jewish myths and the commands of people who have turned away from the truth."},{"number":15,"verse":"Everything is pure to those whose hearts are pure. But nothing is pure to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, because their minds and consciences are corrupted."},{"number":16,"verse":"Such people claim they know God, but they deny him by the way they live. They are detestable and disobedient, worthless for doing anything good."}]}
