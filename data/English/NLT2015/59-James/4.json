Don’t they come from the evil desires at war within you?"},{"number":2,"verse":"You want what you don’t have, so you scheme and kill to get it. You are jealous of what others have, but you can’t get it, so you fight and wage war to take it away from them. Yet you don’t have what you want because you don’t ask God for it."},{"number":3,"verse":"And even when you ask, you don’t get it because your motives are all wrong—you want only what will give you pleasure."},{"number":4,"verse":"You adulterers! (Greek You adulteresses!) Don’t you realize that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of God? I say it again: If you want to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God."},{"number":5,"verse":"Do you think the Scriptures have no meaning? They say that God is passionate that the spirit he has placed within us should be faithful to him. (Or They say that the spirit God has placed within us is filled with envy; or They say that the Holy Spirit, whom God has placed within us, opposes our envy.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"And he gives grace generously. As the Scriptures say, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” (Prov 3:34 (Greek version).)"},{"number":7,"verse":"So humble yourselves before God.

But your job is to obey the law, not to judge whether it applies to you."},{"number":12,"verse":"God alone, who gave the law, is the Judge. He alone has the power to save or to destroy. So what right do you have to judge your neighbor?"},{"number":13,"verse":"(Warning about Self-Confidence) Look here, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we are going to a certain town and will stay there a year.
