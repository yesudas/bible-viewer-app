They were settled in colonies in Halah, along the banks of the Habor River in Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes."},{"number":7,"verse":"This disaster came upon the people of Israel because they worshiped other gods. They sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them safely out of Egypt and had rescued them from the power of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt."},{"number":8,"verse":"They had followed the practices of the pagan nations the LORD had driven from the land ahead of them, as well as the practices the kings of Israel had introduced."},{"number":9,"verse":"The people of Israel had also secretly done many things that were not pleasing to the LORD their God.

Obey my commands and decrees—the entire law that I commanded your ancestors to obey, and that I gave you through my servants the prophets.”"},{"number":14,"verse":"But the Israelites would not listen. They were as stubborn as their ancestors who had refused to believe in the LORD their God."},{"number":15,"verse":"They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their ancestors, and they despised all his warnings.

He has sent lions among them to destroy them because they have not worshiped him correctly.”"},{"number":27,"verse":"The king of Assyria then commanded, “Send one of the exiled priests back to Samaria. Let him live there and teach the new residents the religious customs of the God of the land.”"},{"number":28,"verse":"So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria returned to Bethel and taught the new residents how to worship the LORD."},{"number":29,"verse":"But these various groups of foreigners also continued to worship their own gods. In town after town where they lived, they placed their idols at the pagan shrines that the people of Samaria had built."},{"number":30,"verse":"Those from Babylon worshiped idols of their god Succoth-benoth. Those from Cuthah worshiped their god Nergal. And those from Hamath worshiped Ashima."},{"number":31,"verse":"The Avvites worshiped their gods Nibhaz and Tartak.

They continue to follow their former practices instead of truly worshiping the LORD and obeying the decrees, regulations, instructions, and commands he gave the descendants of Jacob, whose name he changed to Israel."},{"number":35,"verse":"For the LORD had made a covenant with the descendants of Jacob and commanded them: “Do not worship any other gods or bow before them or serve them or offer sacrifices to them."},{"number":36,"verse":"But worship only the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt with great strength and a powerful arm.
