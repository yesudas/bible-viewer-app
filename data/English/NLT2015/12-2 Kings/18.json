He broke up the bronze serpent that Moses had made, because the people of Israel had been offering sacrifices to it. The bronze serpent was called Nehushtan. (Nehushtan sounds like the Hebrew terms that mean “snake,” “bronze,” and “unclean thing.”)"},{"number":5,"verse":"Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before or after his time."},{"number":6,"verse":"He remained faithful to the LORD in everything, and he carefully obeyed all the commands the LORD had given Moses."},{"number":7,"verse":"So the LORD was with him, and Hezekiah was successful in everything he did.

C.) King Sennacherib of Assyria came to attack the fortified towns of Judah and conquered them."},{"number":14,"verse":"King Hezekiah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish: “I have done wrong. I will pay whatever tribute money you demand if you will only withdraw.” The king of Assyria then demanded a settlement of more than eleven tons of silver and one ton of gold. (Hebrew 300 talents [10 metric tons] of silver and 30 talents [1 metric ton] of gold.)"},{"number":15,"verse":"To gather this amount, King Hezekiah used all the silver stored in the Temple of the LORD and in the palace treasury."},{"number":16,"verse":"Hezekiah even stripped the gold from the doors of the LORD’s Temple and from the doorposts he had overlaid with gold, and he gave it all to the Assyrian king."},{"number":17,"verse":"Nevertheless, the king of Assyria sent his commander in chief, his field commander, and his chief of staff (Or the rabshakeh; also in 18:19, 26, 27, 28, 37.) from Lachish with a huge army to confront King Hezekiah in Jerusalem.

Who are you counting on, that you have rebelled against me?"},{"number":21,"verse":"On Egypt? If you lean on Egypt, it will be like a reed that splinters beneath your weight and pierces your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is completely unreliable!"},{"number":22,"verse":"“But perhaps you will say to me, ‘We are trusting in the LORD our God!’ But isn’t he the one who was insulted by Hezekiah?

Strike a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you 2000 horses if you can find that many men to ride on them!"},{"number":24,"verse":"With your tiny army, how can you think of challenging even the weakest contingent of my master’s troops, even with the help of Egypt’s chariots and charioteers?"},{"number":25,"verse":"What’s more, do you think we have invaded your land without the LORD’s direction? The LORD himself told us, ‘Attack this land and destroy it!’”"},{"number":26,"verse":"Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the Assyrian chief of staff, “Please speak to us in Aramaic, for we understand it well. Don’t speak in Hebrew, (Hebrew in the dialect of Judah; also in 18:28.) for the people on the wall will hear.”"},{"number":27,"verse":"But Sennacherib’s chief of staff replied, “Do you think my master sent this message only to you and your master?
