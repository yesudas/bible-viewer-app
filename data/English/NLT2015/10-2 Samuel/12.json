He cuddled it in his arms like a baby daughter."},{"number":4,"verse":"One day a guest arrived at the home of the rich man. But instead of killing an animal from his own flock or herd, he took the poor man’s lamb and killed it and prepared it for his guest.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"David was furious. “As surely as the LORD lives,” he vowed, “any man who would do such a thing deserves to die!"},{"number":6,"verse":"He must repay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole and for having no pity.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"Then Nathan said to David, “You are that man! The LORD, the God of Israel, says: I anointed you king of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul."},{"number":8,"verse":"I gave you your master’s house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. And if that had not been enough, I would have given you much, much more."},{"number":9,"verse":"Why, then, have you despised the word of the LORD and done this horrible deed?

Can I bring him back again? I will go to him one day, but he cannot return to me.”"},{"number":24,"verse":"Then David comforted Bathsheba, his wife, and slept with her. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and David (Hebrew he; an alternate Hebrew reading and some Hebrew manuscripts read she.) named him Solomon. The LORD loved the child"},{"number":25,"verse":"and sent word through Nathan the prophet that they should name him Jedidiah (which means “beloved of the LORD”), as the LORD had commanded.
