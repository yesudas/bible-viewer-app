Therefore the one first entering after the agitation of the water became well, whatever disease he was held by."},{"number":5,"verse":"But a certain man was there, having been in infirmity thirty-eight years."},{"number":6,"verse":"Jesus, seeing this one lying, and knowing that he had already spent much time, He said to him, Do you desire to become well?"},{"number":7,"verse":"The one being infirm answered Him, Lord, I do not have a man, that when the water is agitated he may throw me into the pool; but while I am coming, another goes down before me."},{"number":8,"verse":"Jesus said to him, Rise up, Take up your pallet and walk!"},{"number":9,"verse":"And instantly the man became well, and took up his pallet and walked. And it was a sabbath that day."},{"number":10,"verse":"Therefore the Jews said to the one having been healed, It is sabbath. It is not lawful for you to lift up the pallet."},{"number":11,"verse":"He answered them, The One making me well, that One said to me, Lift up your pallet and walk."},{"number":12,"verse":"Then they asked him, Who is the man who told you, Lift up your pallet and walk?"},{"number":13,"verse":"But the one having been healed did not know who it is, for a crowd being in that place, Jesus had withdrawn."},{"number":14,"verse":"After these things, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become well, sin no more that a worse thing not happen to you."},{"number":15,"verse":"The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus is the One making him well."},{"number":16,"verse":"And because of this the Jews were persecuting Jesus and were seeking to kill Him, because He did these things on a sabbath."},{"number":17,"verse":"But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work."},{"number":18,"verse":"Because of this, therefore, the Jews were seeking the more to kill Him, for not only did He break the sabbath, but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal to God."},{"number":19,"verse":"Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything from Himself, except what He may see the Father doing; for whatever that One does, these things also the Son does likewise."},{"number":20,"verse":"For the Father loves the Son and shows to Him all things which He does. And He will show Him greater works than these in order that you may wonder."},{"number":21,"verse":"For even as the Father raises the dead, and makes alive, so also the Son makes alive whom He wills."},{"number":22,"verse":"For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,"},{"number":23,"verse":"so that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.
