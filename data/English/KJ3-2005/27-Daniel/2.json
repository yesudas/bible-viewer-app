Tell your servants the dream, and we will reveal the meaning."},{"number":5,"verse":"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The word is gone from me.

And He who reveals secrets makes known to you what shall come to pass."},{"number":30,"verse":"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living man, but so that the meaning might be made known to the king, and that you might know the thoughts of your heart."},{"number":31,"verse":"You, O king, were seeing. And, behold, a certain great image! This great image stood before you with a brilliant brightness, and its form was terrible."},{"number":32,"verse":"The head of this image was of fine gold, its breast and its arms were of silver, its belly and its thighs were of bronze,"},{"number":33,"verse":"its legs were of iron, its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay."},{"number":34,"verse":"You continued seeing until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and shattered them."},{"number":35,"verse":"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were together shattered, and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors.

Inasmuch as iron crushes and smashes all things, and as the iron that shatters all these, it will crush and shatter."},{"number":41,"verse":"And as to that you saw, the feet and the toes were partly of potters' clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided. But there shall be in it the strength of iron, because you saw the iron mixed with clay of the potter."},{"number":42,"verse":"And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile."},{"number":43,"verse":"And as you saw the iron mixed with the clay of the clay, they shall be mixed with the seed of men. But they shall not cleave to one another, even as iron does not meld with clay."},{"number":44,"verse":"And in the days of these kings, the God of Heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to another people.
