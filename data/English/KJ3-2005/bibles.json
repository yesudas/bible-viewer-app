Green, Sr. (December 1, 1918 - May 20, 2008) was born at Ennis, KY and became an ordained minister, Bible translator, publisher, and businessman. He was educated at Washington University of St. Louis, Toronto Baptist Seminary, and Covenant Theological Seminary of St. Louis. He died May 20, 2008 in Lafayette, Indiana. He finsihed the KJ3 Bible two weeks before going home to Our Lord and Saviour at which time he stated it is finished. Green's motivation to produce a translation of the Bible that is easier to understand began when he was trying to read the King James Version to his children and they asked, “Daddy, why don’t you make a Bible that we can understand?” His first effort was the Children’s King James Version, New Testament (1960). Another is Green's Literal Translation. He has gone on to produce a large number of translations of the Bible into English, some revised multiple times, including The Interlinear Hebrew-Greek-English Bible, in One-Volume. He has described himself as \"the most experienced Bible translator now alive\" (Paul 2003:99). In addition to producing multiple translations of the Bible, he has also published other books, as well. In 1970 we published the King James II Bible, and altogether sold 250,000 of them. This was an updating of the Modern King James Version, again working from the King James Version English. It was in 1975 that He moved me to undertake the Interlinear Hebrew-GreekEnglish Bible. This was prompted after being approached by a number of Christians asking me why the Modern King James and the King James II didn't correct the errors in the KJV. In his own words: \"I asked what errors upon which they pointed some out to me. It became obvious that to enable a more correct translation, I would have to work directly from the Greek and Hebrew. To accommodate this, I went back to school to learn Greek and Hebrew and engaged the efforts of Dr. Maurice Robinson, a world renown Biblical Language scholar to assist me. If was while attempting to work with the Greek and Hebrew Lexicons and concordances, that I came to recognize the difficulty in locating the Greek and Hebrew words within the reference books, It was especially difficult with the Hebrew where the root of the word is frequently found in the middle of the word. It was at this time we decided that what was need was to place Strong's Concordance numbers alongside the reference work entries to enable us to more quickly reference the needed Greek or Hebrew word\" KJ3 is the translation that appears in the side margins of Jay P. Green, Sr.'s best-selling series of The Interlinear Hebrew-Greek-English Bible. This is the fourth edition of this most accurate of all versions. Due to additional intense study, and the suggestions of others, we feel confident that this version has now been perfected. The difference between the KJ3 Bible and all other English versions ever created in the past is this: This is the first time that any version has contained all of God’s words, as He wrote them, with no words added, and no words deleted. Note that God has commanded this several times. See Deuteronomy 4:2, 12:32, Proverbs 30:6, Revelation 22:18, 19. KJ3/LITV ''You shall not add onto the Word I command you, neither shall you take away from it, to keep the commandments which I have commanded you.'' When a version adds words to the words that God breathed out or fails to translate what God has written, and hides from the reader what they have added or subtracted from God’s word, they are deceiving the reader by in effect saying, ''These are the words that God wrote,'' when the truth is that God did not write many of the words that they have put into their Bibles.","copyRight":"Sovereign Grace Publishers,
