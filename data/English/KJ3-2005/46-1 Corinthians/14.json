For the one prophesying is greater than the one speaking in languages, if not he interpret, that the assembly may receive building up."},{"number":6,"verse":"But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in languages, what will I profit you, if not I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?"},{"number":7,"verse":"Likewise lifeless things giving a sound, whether flute or harp, if they do not give a distinction in the sound, how will it be known what is being fluted or being harped?"},{"number":8,"verse":"For also if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will get himself ready for war?"},{"number":9,"verse":"So also you, if you do not give a clear word through the language, how will the thing being said be known? For you will be speaking into air."},{"number":10,"verse":"So it may be many kinds of sounds are in the world, and not one is without distinct sound."},{"number":11,"verse":"If, then, I do not know the power of the sound, I will be a foreigner to the one speaking, and he speaking in me a foreigner."},{"number":12,"verse":"So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek to build up the assembly that you may abound."},{"number":13,"verse":"Therefore, the one speaking in a language, let him pray that he may interpret."},{"number":14,"verse":"For if I pray in a foreign language, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful."},{"number":15,"verse":"What then is it? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind."},{"number":16,"verse":"Else, if you bless in the spirit, the one occupying the place of the unlearned, how will he say the amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you say?"},{"number":17,"verse":"For you truly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up."},{"number":18,"verse":"I thank my God that I speak more languages than all of you."},{"number":19,"verse":"But in an assembly I desire to speak five words with my mind, that I may also instruct others, than myriads of words in a foreign language."},{"number":20,"verse":"Brothers, do not be children in your minds, but in malice act like children, and in your minds be mature."},{"number":21,"verse":"It is written in the Law, \"By other languages\" and \"by other lips\" \"I will speak to this people,\" \"and even so they will not hear\" Me, says the Lord.

But prophecy is not to the faithless ones, but to the ones believing."},{"number":23,"verse":"Then if the whole assembly comes together, and all speak in foreign languages, and uninstructed or faithless ones come in, will they not say that you rave?"},{"number":24,"verse":"But if all prophesy, and some faithless one or an uninstructed one comes in, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all."},{"number":25,"verse":"And so the secrets of his heart become revealed; and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is truly among you."},{"number":26,"verse":"Then what is it, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, he has a teaching, he has a language, he has a revelation, he has an interpretation. Let all things be for building up."},{"number":27,"verse":"If one speaks in a language, let it be by two or three at the most, and in turn, also let one interpret."},{"number":28,"verse":"And if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God."},{"number":29,"verse":"And if there are two or three prophets, let them speak, and let the others judge."},{"number":30,"verse":"But if a revelation is revealed to another sitting by, let the first be silent."},{"number":31,"verse":"For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be encouraged."},{"number":32,"verse":"And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets."},{"number":33,"verse":"For God is not God of confusion, but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints."},{"number":34,"verse":"Let your women be silent in the assemblies, for it is not allowed to them to speak, but to be in subjection, as also the Law says."},{"number":35,"verse":"But if they desire to learn anything, let them question their husbands at home; for it is a disgraceful thing for a woman to speak in an assembly."},{"number":36,"verse":"Or did the Word of God go out from you? Or did it reach only to you?"},{"number":37,"verse":"If anyone thinks to be a prophet, or a spiritual one, let him recognize the things I write to you, that they are commandments of the Lord."},{"number":38,"verse":"But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant."},{"number":39,"verse":"So then, brothers, seek eagerly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in languages."},{"number":40,"verse":"And let all things come to be done decently and according to order."}]}
