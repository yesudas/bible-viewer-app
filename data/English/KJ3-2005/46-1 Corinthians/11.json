But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn, or to be shaved, let her be covered."},{"number":7,"verse":"For truly a man ought not to have the head covered, being the image and glory of God. But woman is the glory of man;"},{"number":8,"verse":"for man is not of the woman, but woman of man;"},{"number":9,"verse":"for also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man;"},{"number":10,"verse":"because of this, the woman ought to have authority on the head, because of the angels."},{"number":11,"verse":"But neither is the man apart from woman, nor woman apart from man, in the Lord."},{"number":12,"verse":"For as the woman is out of the man, so also the man through the woman; but all things from God."},{"number":13,"verse":"You judge among yourselves: is it fitting for a woman to pray to God uncovered?"},{"number":14,"verse":"Or does not nature herself teach you that if a man indeed wears long hair, it is a dishonor to him?"},{"number":15,"verse":"But if a woman wears her hair long, it is a glory to her; because the long hair has been given to her instead of a covering."},{"number":16,"verse":"But if anyone thinks to be contentious, we do not have such a custom, nor the assemblies of God."},{"number":17,"verse":"But enjoining this, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better, but for the worse."},{"number":18,"verse":"Indeed, first, I hear divisions to be among you when you come together in the assembly.
