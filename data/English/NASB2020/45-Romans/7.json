Is the Law sin? (Lit May it never happen!) Far from it! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except (Or through law) through the Law; for I would not have known about (Or lust) coveting if the Law had not said, “YOU SHALL NOT (Or lust) COVET.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"But sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me (Or lust) coveting of every kind; for apart (Or from law) from the Law sin is dead."},{"number":9,"verse":"I was once alive apart (Or from law) from the Law; but when the commandment came, sin came to life, and I died;"},{"number":10,"verse":"and this commandment, which was (Lit to life) to result in life, proved (Lit to death) to result in death for me;"},{"number":11,"verse":"for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through it, killed me."},{"number":12,"verse":"So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good."},{"number":13,"verse":"Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me? (Lit May it never happen!) Far from it! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin by bringing about my death through that which is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful."},{"number":14,"verse":"(The Conflict of Serving Two Masters) For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold (Lit under sin) into bondage to sin."},{"number":15,"verse":"For I do not understand what I am doing; for I am not practicing what I want to do, but I do the very thing I hate."},{"number":16,"verse":"However, if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with the Law, that the Law is good."},{"number":17,"verse":"But now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin that dwells in me."},{"number":18,"verse":"For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not."},{"number":19,"verse":"For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want."},{"number":20,"verse":"But if I do the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that dwells in me."},{"number":21,"verse":"I find then the (Lit law) principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good."},{"number":22,"verse":"For I joyfully agree with the law of God (Or with respect to) in the inner person,"},{"number":23,"verse":"but I see a different law in (Lit my parts waging) the parts of my body waging war against the law of my mind, and making me a prisoner (Lit in) of the law of sin, the law which is in (Lit my parts) my body’s parts."},{"number":24,"verse":"Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from (Or this body of death) the body of this death?"},{"number":25,"verse":"Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!
