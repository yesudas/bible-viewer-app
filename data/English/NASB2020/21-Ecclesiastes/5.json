For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few."},{"number":3,"verse":"For the dream comes through much (Lit task) effort, and the voice of a fool through many words."},{"number":4,"verse":"When you make a vow to God, do not be late in paying it; for He takes no delight in fools. Pay what you vow!"},{"number":5,"verse":"It is better that you not vow, than vow and not pay."},{"number":6,"verse":"Do not let your (Lit mouth) speech cause (Lit your body) you to sin, and do not say in the presence of the messenger of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry on account of your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?"},{"number":7,"verse":"For in many dreams and in many words there is futility. Rather, (Or revere) fear God."},{"number":8,"verse":"If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the (Lit delight) sight; for one (Lit high one) official watches over another (Lit high one) official, and there are higher (Lit ones) officials over them."},{"number":9,"verse":"After all, a king who cultivates the field is beneficial to the land."},{"number":10,"verse":"The Foolishness of Riches One who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor one who loves abundance with its income.

So what is the advantage to their owners except to (Lit see with their eyes) look at them?"},{"number":12,"verse":"The sleep of the laborer is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the (Lit satiety) full stomach of the rich person does not allow him to sleep."},{"number":13,"verse":"There is a sickening evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth being (Lit guarded) hoarded by its owner to his detriment."},{"number":14,"verse":"When that wealth was lost through bad business and he had fathered a son, then there was nothing (Lit in his hand) to support him."},{"number":15,"verse":"As he came naked from his mother’s womb, so he will return as he came. He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand."},{"number":16,"verse":"This also is a sickening evil: exactly as a person (Lit comes) is born, so will he (Lit go) die.
