But even now you are not yet able,"},{"number":3,"verse":"for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like ordinary people?"},{"number":4,"verse":"For when one person says, “I am (Lit of) with Paul,” and another, “I am (Lit of) with Apollos,” are you not ordinary people?"},{"number":5,"verse":"What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one."},{"number":6,"verse":"I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth."},{"number":7,"verse":"So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth."},{"number":8,"verse":"Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one; but each will receive his own (Or wages) reward according to his own labor."},{"number":9,"verse":"For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s (Or cultivated land) field, God’s building."},{"number":10,"verse":"According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it.
