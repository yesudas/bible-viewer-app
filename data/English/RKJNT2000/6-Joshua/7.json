Is the law sin? By no means. On the contrary, I would not have known sin, but by the law: for I would not have known about coveting unless the law had said, You shall not covet."},{"number":8,"verse":"But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For without the law sin is dead."},{"number":9,"verse":"For I was once alive without the law: but when the commandment came, sin became alive, and I died."},{"number":10,"verse":"And the commandment, which was intended to bring life, I found to bring death."},{"number":11,"verse":"For sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me."},{"number":12,"verse":"Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, and just, and good."},{"number":13,"verse":"Then did that which is good bring death to me? By no means. But sin, that it might appear to be sin, worked death in me by that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceedingly sinful."},{"number":14,"verse":"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold into bondage to sin."},{"number":15,"verse":"I do not understand that which I do: for I do not do what I want to do; but what I hate is the very thing I do."},{"number":16,"verse":"But if I do that which I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good."},{"number":17,"verse":"Now then it is no longer I who does it, but sin which dwells in me."},{"number":18,"verse":"For I know that in myself (that is, in my flesh,) no good thing dwells: for to desire what is right is present within me; but to perform what is right, this I cannot do."},{"number":19,"verse":"For I do not do the good that I want: but the evil which I do not want, that is what I do."},{"number":20,"verse":"Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin which dwells in me."},{"number":21,"verse":"So I find this law at work, that when I want to do good, evil is present with me."},{"number":22,"verse":"For I delight in the law of God in my inner man:"},{"number":23,"verse":"But I see another law in the members of my body, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."},{"number":24,"verse":"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?"},{"number":25,"verse":"Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then, with my mind I myself serve the law of God; but with my flesh the law of sin."}]}
