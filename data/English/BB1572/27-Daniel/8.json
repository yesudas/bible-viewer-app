[euen] vnto me Daniel, after that which I had seene in the beginning."},{"number":2,"verse":"I saw in a vision (and when I saw it, I was in the palace of Susis, which is in the prouince of Elam) and in the vision me thought I was by the riuer of Ulai."},{"number":3,"verse":"Then I loked vp and saw, & beholde, there stoode before the riuer a ramme which had two hornes: and these two hornes were hye, but one was hyer then the other, & the hyest came vp last."},{"number":4,"verse":"I saw that this ramme pushed with his hornes against the west, against the north, and against the south: so that no beastes might stand before him, nor defend them from his power, but he did as him listed, and became great."},{"number":5,"verse":"And as I considered, beholde there came a hee goate from the west, ouer the whole earth, and touched not the grounde: and this goate had a horne appeared betwixt his eyes."},{"number":6,"verse":"And he came vnto the ramme that had the two hornes (whom I had seene standing by the riuer) and ranne fiercely vpon him with his might."},{"number":7,"verse":"And I sawe him drawe nye vnto the ramme, being very fierce vpon him, yea he smote the ramme and brake his two hornes, neither had the ramme so much strength as to stande before him: but he cast him downe to the grounde, trode him vnder his feete, & there was none able to deliuer the ramme out of his power."},{"number":8,"verse":"Therefore the goate waxed exceeding great, & when he was at the strongest, his great horne was broken: Then grew there other foure notable ones in the steade of it,

dayly [sacrifice] for the iniquitie, and it shall cast downe the trueth to the grounde: and thus shall it do, and prosper."},{"number":13,"verse":"Upon this, I heard one of the sainctes speaking, and one of the sainctes spake vnto Palmoni, saying: how long shal the vision of the dayly [sacrifice] and of the iniquitie of desolation [endure,] to geue both the sanctuarie and the power to be troden vnder foote?"},{"number":14,"verse":"And he aunswered me: Unto the euening and the morning, two thousand and three hundred: then shal the sanctuarie be cleansed."},{"number":15,"verse":"Now when I Daniel had seene this vision, and sought for the vnderstanding of it: beholde, there stoode before me like the similitude of a man."},{"number":16,"verse":"And I heard a mans voyce betweene Ulai, which cryed, and saide: O Gabriel make this man vnderstande the vision."},{"number":17,"verse":"So he came and stoode by me: but I was afraide at his comming, and fell downe vpo my face: Then said he

fulfilled."},{"number":20,"verse":"The ramme which thou sawest hauing two hornes, is the king of the Medes and Perses,"},{"number":21,"verse":"And the goate, is the king of Grecia: and the great horne that is betwixt his eyes, that is the first king."},{"number":22,"verse":"But where as it brake, & foure other rose vp in the steade: [it signifieth,] that out of this people shall stande vp foure kingdomes, but not so mightie as it."},{"number":23,"verse":"And in the ende of their kingdome, when the wicked are come to the full, a king of a fierce countenaunce, and vnderstanding harde sentences, shall stand vp."},{"number":24,"verse":"His power shalbe mightie, but not in his strength, & he shall destroy wonderfully, he shall prosper & practise, and destroy the mightie and the holy people."},{"number":25,"verse":"And through his policie also he shall cause craft to prosper in his handes, he shall extoll him selfe in his heart, and in prosperitie he shall destroy many, & many one shalbe put to death in his wealthinesse: he shall stande vp against the prince of princes, but he shalbe destroyed without hande."},{"number":26,"verse":"And the vision of the euening and the morning, which is declared, is true: therfore seale thou vp the vision, for it shalbe after many dayes."},{"number":27,"verse":"Upon this was I Daniel feeble, so that I lay sicke [certaine] dayes: but when I rose vp, I went about ye kinges busines, and was astonied at the vision, neuerthelesse, no man vnderstoode it."}]}
