set him to be their watchman:"},{"number":3,"verse":"If when he seeth the sworde come vpon the lande, he shall blow the trumpet and warne the people:"},{"number":4,"verse":"Then he that heareth the noyse of the trumpet and wyll not be warned, and the sworde come and take him away, his blood shalbe vpon his owne head."},{"number":5,"verse":"For he heard the sounde of the trumpet, and would not be warned, therefore his blood be vpon him: but he that receaueth warning, he shall saue his lyfe."},{"number":6,"verse":"Againe, if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, so that the

therefore tel them, thus saith the Lorde God, In the blood haue ye eaten, your eyes haue ye lift vp to idols, and haue shed blood: shall ye then haue the lande in possession?"},{"number":26,"verse":"Ye leane vpon your swordes, ye worke abhominations, euery one defileth his neighbours wyfe: and shall ye then possesse the lande?"},{"number":27,"verse":"Say thou thus vnto them, thus saith the lorde God: As truely as I liue, they that are in the desolate places shall fall by the sworde, and him that is vpon the fielde wyll I geue vnto the beastes to be deuoured: and they that be in the strong holdes and dennes shall dye of the pestilence."},{"number":28,"verse":"For I wyll make the lande so desolate and waste, that the pompe of her strength shall

come, and my people syt before thee, and heare thy wordes, but they do not therafter: for in their mouthes they make a iest of them, and their heart goeth after their couetousnes."},{"number":32,"verse":"And lo, thou art vnto them as a testing song of one that hath a pleasaunt voyce, and can sing well: for they heare thy wordes, but do them not."},{"number":33,"verse":"When this commeth to passe (lo it commeth:) then shall they knowe that there hath ben a prophete among them."}]}
