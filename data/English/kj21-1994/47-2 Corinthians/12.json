I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord:"},{"number":2,"verse":"I knew a man in Christ more than fourteen years ago (whether in the body I cannot tell, or whether out of the body I cannot tell -- God knoweth). Such a one was caught up to the third Heaven."},{"number":3,"verse":"And I knew such a man (whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell -- God knoweth),"},{"number":4,"verse":"and how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter."},{"number":5,"verse":"Of such a one will I glory, yet of myself I will not glory, except in mine infirmities."},{"number":6,"verse":"For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool, for I will say the truth. But now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or than he heareth of me."},{"number":7,"verse":"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."},{"number":8,"verse":"For this thing, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me."},{"number":9,"verse":"And He said unto me, \"My grace is sufficent for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.\" Most gladly therefore will I glory rather in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."},{"number":10,"verse":"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in privations, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then am I strong."},{"number":11,"verse":"I have become a fool in glorying.
