In seven years he made and finished them. And Solomon had seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eight thousand hewers of stone in the mountain: and Solomon made the sea, and the bases, and the great lavers, and the pillars, and the fountain of the court, and the brazen seaâ€” (Gr. ran. ) and he built the citadel as a defence above it, he made a breach in the wall of the city of David: thus the daughter of Pharao went up out of the city of David to her house which he built for her. Then he built the citadel: and Solomon offered up three whole-burnt-offerings in the year, and peace-offerings on the altar which he built to the Lord, and he burnt incense before the Lord, and finished the house. And these are the chief persons who presided over the works of Solomon; three thousand and six hundred masters of the people that wrought the works. And he burit Assur, and Magdo, and Gazer, and upper Baethoron, and Ballath: only after he had built the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about, afterwards he built these cities. And when David was yet living, he charged Solomon, saying, Behold, there is with thee Semei the son of Gera, of the seed of (Or. tributes. ) Benjamin out of Chebron: he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the camp; and he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, (Gr. if he shall be slain. ) He shall not be slain with the sword. But now do not thou hold him guiltless, for thou art a man of understanding, and thou wilt know what thou shalt do to him, and thou shalt bring down his (Gr. hoary head. ) grey hairs with blood to (Gr. Hades. ) the grave. (The verses below numbered 36) to 46) appear between verses one and two in Brenton. ) And the king called Semei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and thou shalt not go out thence any whither. And it shall come to pass in the day (Gr. of thy going forth. ) that thou shalt go forth and cross over the brook Kedron, (Gr. knowing thou shalt know. ) know assuredly that thou shalt certainly die: thy blood shall be upon thine head. And the king caused him to swear in that day. And Semei said to the king, Good is the word that thou hast spoken, my lord O king: thus will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem three years. And it came to pass after the three years, that two servants of Semei ran away to Anchus son of Maacha king of Geth: and it was told Semei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Geth. And Semei rose up, and saddled his ass, and went to Geth to Anchus to seek out his servants: and Semei went, and brought his servants out of Geth. And it was told Solomon, saying, Semei is gone out of Jerusalem to Geth, and has brought back his servants. And the king sent and called Semei, and said to him, Did I not adjure thee by the Lord, and testify to thee, saying, In whatsoever day thou shalt go out of Jerusalem, and go to the right or left, know certainly that thou shalt assuredly die? And why hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment which I commanded (Gr. against thee. ) thee? And the king said to Semei, Thou knowest all thy mischief which thy heart knows, which thou didst to David my father: and the Lord has recompensed thy mischief on thine own head. And king Solomon is blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever. And Solomon commanded Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he went forth and slew him. And king Solomon was very prudent and wise: and Juda and Israel were very many, as the sand which is by the sea for multitude, eating, and drinking, and rejoicing: and Solomon was chief in all the kingdoms, and they brought gifts, and served Solomon all the days of his life. And Solomon began to open the domains of Libanus, and he built Thermae in the wilderness. And this was the (Gr. dinner. ) daily provision of Solomon, thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of ground meal, ten choice calves, and twenty oxen from the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides stags, and does, and choice fed birds. For he ruled in all the country on this side the river, from Raphi unto Gaza, over all the kings (Gr. beyond. ) on this side the river: and he was at peace on all sides round about; and Juda and Israel dwelt (Gr. trusting in confidence. See Heb. ) safely, every one under his vine and under his fig tree, eating and drinand feasting, from Dan even to Bersabee, all the days of Solomon. And these were the princes of Solomon; Azariu son of Sadoc the priest, and Orniu son of Nathan chief of the officers, and he (Gr. ran. ) went to his house; and Suba the scribe, and Basa son of Achithalam recorder, and Abi son of Joab commander-in-chief, and Achire son of Edrai was over the (Or. tributes. ) levies, and Banaeas son of Jodae over the household and over the brickwork, and Cachur the son of Nathan was counsellor. And Solomon had forty thousand brood mares for his chariots, and twelve thousand horses. And he reigned over all the kings from the river and to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt: so Solomon the son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem."},{"number":2,"verse":"Nevertheless the people burnt incense on the high places, because a house had not yet been built to the Lord."},{"number":3,"verse":"And Solomon loved the Lord, so as to walk in the ordinances of David his father; only he sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places."},{"number":4,"verse":"And he arose and went to Gabaon to sacrifice there, for that was the highest place, and great: Solomon offered a whole-burnt-offering of a thousand victims on the altar in Gabaon."},{"number":5,"verse":"And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and the Lord said to Solomon, Ask some petition for thyself."},{"number":6,"verse":"And Solomon said, Thou hast dealt very mercifully with thy servant David my father according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee, and thou hast kept for him this great mercy, to (Gr. give. ) set his son upon his throne, (Gr. as this day is. ) as it is this day."},{"number":7,"verse":"And now, O Lord my God, thou hast (Gr. given. ) appointed thy servant in the room of David my father; and I am a little child, and know not my going out an my coming in."},{"number":8,"verse":"But thy servant is in the midst of thy people, whom thou hast chosen, a great people, which as this day (Gr. shall or will not. ) cannot be numbered."},{"number":9,"verse":"Thou shalt give therefore to thy servant a heart to hear and to judge thy people justly, and to discern between good and evil: for who will be able to judge this thy (Gr. heavy. ) great people?"},{"number":10,"verse":"And it was pleasing before the Lord, that Solomon asked this thing."},{"number":11,"verse":"And the Lord said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing of me, and hast not asked for thyself (Gr. many days. ) long life, and hast not asked wealth, nor hast asked the lives of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to hear judgment;"},{"number":12,"verse":"behold, I have done according to thy word: behold, I have given thee an understanding and wise heart: there has not been any one like thee before thee, and after thee there shall not arise one like thee."},{"number":13,"verse":"And I have given thee what thou hast not asked, wealth and glory, so that there has not been any one like thee among kings."},{"number":14,"verse":"And if thou wilt walk in my way, to keep my commandments and my ordinances, as David thy father walked, then will I multiply thy days."},{"number":15,"verse":"And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream: and he arose and (Gr. comes. ) came to Jerusalem, and stood before the altar that was in front of the ark of the covenant of the Lord in Sion: and he offered whole-burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings, and made a great banquet for himself and all his servants."},{"number":16,"verse":"Then there appeared two harlots before the king, and they stood before him."},{"number":17,"verse":"And the one woman said, Hear me, my lord; I and this woman dwelt in one house, and we were delivered in the house."},{"number":18,"verse":"And it came to pass on the third day after I was delivered, this woman also was delivered: and we were together; and there (Gr. is. ) was no one with us besides our two selves in the house."},{"number":19,"verse":"And this woman's child died in the night; because she (Gr. slept upon it. ) overlaid it."},{"number":20,"verse":"and she arose in the middle of the night, (Heb. and Alex.+ 'while thine handmaid slept.' ) and took my son from my arms, and laid him in her bosom, and (Gr. caused to sleep. ) laid her dead son in my bosom."},{"number":21,"verse":"and I arose in the morning to suckle my son, and he was dead: and, behold, I considered him in the morning, and, behold, it was not my son whom I bore."},{"number":22,"verse":"And the other woman said, No, but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son.
