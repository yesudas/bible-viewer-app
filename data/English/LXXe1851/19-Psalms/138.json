(9)If I should spread my wings to fly (Alex. κατ᾿ ὄρθον, toward the dawn. ) straight forward, and sojourn at the extremity of the sea, it would be vain, (10)for even there thy hand would guide me, and thy right hand would hold me. (11)When I said, Surely the darkness will cover me; even the night was light in my (Comp. Heb. ) luxury. (12)For darkness will not be darkness with thee; but night will be light as day: as its darkness, so shall its light be to thee. (13)For thou, O Lord, hast possessed my reins; thou hast helped me from my mother's womb. (14)I will give thee thanks; for thou art fearfully wondrous; wondrous are thy works; and my soul knows it well. (15)My bones, which thou madest in secret were not hidden from thee, nor my substance, in the lowest parts of the earth. (16)Thine eyes saw my unwrought substance, and all men shall be written in thy book; they shall be formed by day, though there should for a time be no one among them. (17)But thy friends, O God, have been greatly honoured by me; their rule has been greatly strengthened. (18)I will number them, and they shall be multiplied beyond the sand; I awake, and am still with thee. (19)Oh that thou wouldest slay the wicked, O God; depart from me, ye men of blood. (20)For thou wilt say concerning their thought, that they shall take thy cities in vain. (21)Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hate thee? and wasted away because of thine enemies? (22)I have hated them with perfect hatred; they were counted my enemies. (23)Prove me, O God, and know my heart; examine me, and know my paths; (24)and see if there is any way of iniquity in me, and lead me in an everlasting way."}]}
