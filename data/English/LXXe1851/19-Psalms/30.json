(13)For I heard the slander of many that dwelt round about: when they were gathered together against me, they took counsel to take my life. (14)But I hoped in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God. (15)My lots are in thy hands: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, (16)and from them that persecute me. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me in thy mercy. (17)O Lord, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be ashamed, and brought down to Hades. (18)Let the deceitful lips become dumb, which speak iniquity against the righteous with pride and scorn. (19)How abundant is the multitude of thy goodness, O Lord, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee! thou hast wrought it out for them that hope on thee, in the presence of the sons of men. (20)Thou wilt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the vexation of man: thou wilt screen them in a tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues. (21)Blessed be the Lord: for he has magnified his mercy in a fortified city. (22)But I said in my extreme fear, I am cast out from the sight of thine eyes: therefore thou didst hearken, O Lord, to the voice of my supplication when I cried to thee. (23)Love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord seeks for truth, and renders a reward to them that deal very proudly. (24)Be of good courage, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord."}]}
