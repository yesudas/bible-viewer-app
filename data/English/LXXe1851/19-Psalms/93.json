(6)They have slain the widow and fatherless, and murdered the stranger. (7)And they said, The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob understand. (8)Understand now, ye simple among the people; and ye fools, at length be wise. (9)He that planted the ear, does he not hear? or he that formed the eye, does not he perceive? (10)He that chastises the heathen, shall not he punish, even he that teaches man knowledge? (11) (1Cor 3:20. ) The Lord knows the thoughts of men, that they are vain. (12)Blessed is the man whomsoever thou shalt chasten, O Lord, and shalt teach him out of thy law; (13)to give him rest from evil days, until a pit be digged for the sinful one. (14)For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance; (15)until righteousness return to judgment, and all the upright in heart shall follow it. Pause. (16)Who will rise up for me against the transgressors? or who will stand up with me against the workers of iniquity? (17)If the Lord had not helped me, my soul had almost sojourned in Hades. (18)If I said, My foot has been moved; (19)thy mercy, O Lord, helped me. O Lord, according to the multitude of my griefs within my heart, thy consolation have (Lit. 'have loved'. Alex. ἠὺφπαναν, 'have gladdened'.) soothed my soul. (20)Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frames mischief by an ordinance? (21)They will hunt for the soul of the righteous, and condemn innocent blood. (22)But the Lord was my refuge; and my God the helper of my hope. (23)And he will recompense to them their iniquity and their wickedness: the Lord our God shall utterly destroy them."}]}
