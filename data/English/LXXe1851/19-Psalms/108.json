(14)Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. (15)Let them be before the Lord continually; and let their memorial be blotted out from the earth. (16)Because he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the needy and poor man, and that to slay him that was pricked in the heart. (17)He loved cursing also, and it shall come upon him; and he took not pleasure in blessing, so it shall be removed far from him. (18)Yea, he put on cursing as a garment, and it is come as water into his bowels, and as oil into his bones. (19)Let it be to him as a garment which he puts on, and as a girdle with which he girds himself continually. (20)This is the dealing of the Lord with those who falsely accuse me, and of them that speak evil against my soul. (21)But thou, O Lord, Lord, deal mercifully with me, for thy name's sake: for thy mercy is good. (22)Deliver me, for I am poor and needy; and my heart is troubled within me. (23)I am removed as a shadow in its going down: I am tossed up and down like locusts. (24)My knees are weakened through fasting, and my flesh is changed by reason of the want of oil. (25)I became also a reproach to them: when they saw me they shook their heads. (26)Help me, O Lord my God; and save me according to thy mercy. (27)And let them know that this is thy hand; and that thou, Lord, hast wrought it. (28)Let them curse, but thou shalt bless: let them that rise up against me be ashamed, but let thy servant rejoice. (29)Let those that falsely accuse me be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a mantle. (30)I will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth; and in the midst of many I will praise him. (31)For he stood on the right hand of the poor, to save me from them that persecute my soul."}]}
