(19)Then thou spokest in vision to thy children, and saidst, I have laid help on a mighty one; I have exalted one chosen out of my people. (20) (Act 13:22. ) I have found David my servant; I have anointed him by my holy (Heb. and Alex. oil, see Ps. 91. (92) 10. ) mercy. (21)For my hand shall support him; and mine arm shall strengthen him. (22)The enemy shall have no advantage against him; and the son of transgression shall not hurt him again. (23)And I will hew down his foes before him, and put to flight those that hate him. (24)But my truth and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted. (25)And I will set his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. (26)He shall call upon me, saying, Thou art my Father, my God, and the helper of my salvation. (27)And I will make him my first-born, higher than the kings of the earth. (28)I will keep my mercy for him for ever, and my covenant shall be firm with him. (29)And I will establish his seed for ever and ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. (30)If his children should forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; (31)if they should profane my ordinances, and not keep my commandments; (32)I will visit their transgressions with a rod, and their sins with scourges. (33)But my mercy I will not utterly remove from him, nor wrong my truth. (34)Neither will I by any means profane my covenant; and I will not make void the things that proceed out of my lips. (35)Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie to David. (36)His see shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me; (37)and as the moon that is established for ever, and as the faithful witness in heaven. Pause. (38)But thou hast cast off and set at nought, thou has rejected thine anointed. (39)Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant; thou has profaned his sanctuary, casting it to the ground. (40)Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast made his strong holds a terror. (41)All that go by the way have spoiled him: he is become a reproach to his neighbours. (42)Thou hast exalted the right hand of his enemies; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. (43)Thou hast turned back the help of his sword, and hast not helped him in the battle. (44)Thou hast deprived him of (Gr. purification. ) glory: thou hast broken down his throne to the ground. (45)Thou hast shortened the days of his (Alex. time. ) throne: thou hast poured shame upon him. Pause. (46)How long, O Lord, wilt thou turn away, for ever? shall thine anger flame out as fire? (47)Remember what my being is: for hast thou created all the sons of men in vain? (48)What man is there who shall live, and not see death? shall any one deliver his soul from the hand of Hades? Pause. (49)Where are thine ancient mercies, O Lord, which thou swarest to David in thy truth? (50)Remember, O Lord, the reproach of thy servants, which I have borne in my bosom, even the reproach of many nations; (51)wherewith thine enemies have reviled, O Lord: wherewith they have reviled the recompense of thine anointed. (52)Blessed be the Lord for ever. So be it, so be it."}]}
