(9)O God, thou wilt grant to thine inheritance a gracious rain; for it was weary, but thou didst refresh it. (10)Thy (See the Hebrew. ) creatures dwell in it: thou hast in thy goodness prepared for the poor. (11)The Lord God will give a word to them that preach it in a great company. (12)The king of the forces of the beloved, of the beloved, will even grant them for the beauty of the house to divide the spoils. (13)Even if ye should lie among the lots, ye shall have the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her breast with (Lit. greenness of gold. ) yellow gold. (14)When the heavenly One scatters kings upon it, they shall be made snow-white in Selmon. (15)The mountain of God is a rich mountain; a (Gr. curdled like cheese. ) swelling mountain, a rich mountain. (16)Wherefore do ye conceive evil, ye swelling mountains? this is the mountain which God has delighted to dwell in; yea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever. (17)The chariots of God are ten thousand fold, thousands of rejoicing ones: the Lord is among them, in Sina, in the holy place. (18) (Gr. having gone up. ) Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, thou hast received gifts for man, yea, for they were rebellious, that thou mightest dwell among them. (19)Blessed be the Lord God, blessed be the Lord daily; and the God of our salvation shall prosper us. Pause. (20)Our God is the God of salvation; and to the Lord belong the issues from death. (21)But God shall crust the heads of his enemies; the hairy crown of them that go on in their trespasses. (22)The Lord said, I will bring again from Basan, I will bring my people again through the depths of the sea. (23)That thy foot may be dipped in blood, and the tongue of thy dogs be stained with that of thine enemies. (24)Thy goings, O God, have been seen; the goings of my God, the king, in the sanctuary. (25)The princes went first, next before the players on instruments, in the midst of damsels playing on timbrels. (26)Praise God in the congregations, the Lord from the fountains of Israel. (27)There is Benjamin the younger one in ecstasy, the princes of Juda their rulers, the princes of Zabulon, the princes of Nephthali. (28)O God, command thou thy strength: strengthen, O God, this which thou hast wrought in us. (29)Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents to thee. (30)Rebuke the wild beasts of the reed: let the crowd of bulls with the heifers of the nations be rebuked, so that they who have been proved with silver may not be shut out: scatter thou the nations that wish for wars. (31)Ambassadors shall arrive out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out her hand readily to God. (32)Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth; sing psalms to the Lord. Pause. (33)Sing to God that (Gr. mounts, or, has mounted. ) rides on the heaven of heaven, eastward: lo, he will utter a mighty sound with his voice. (34)Give ye glory to God: his excellency is over Israel, and his power is in the clouds. (35)God is wonderful (Or, among his holy ones. ) in his holy places, the God of Israel: he will give power and strength to his people: blessed be God."}]}
