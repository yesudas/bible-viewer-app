They continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense at those places, instead of at the place that God had chosen for them in Jerusalem."},{"number":4,"verse":"Joash said to the priests, \"You must take all the money which the people give, both the money they are required to pay and the money that they themselves decide to give, as sacred offerings to buy things for the temple."},{"number":5,"verse":"Each priest must take the money from the people who come to him, and he must use that money to repair the temple whenever he sees that there is something that needs to be repaired.\""},{"number":6,"verse":"But after Joash had been ruling for almost twenty-three years, the priests still had not repaired anything in the temple."},{"number":7,"verse":"So Joash summoned Jehoiada and the other priests and said to them, \"Why are you not repairing things in the temple?
