And while they listened, the king read to them all of the laws that Moses had written. He read from the scroll that had been found in the temple."},{"number":3,"verse":"Then the king stood next to the pillar where the kings stood when they made important announcements, and, while Yahweh was listening, he repeated his promise to sincerely obey with his inner being the covenant. And all the people also promised to obey the covenant."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then the king gave a command to Hilkiah, the high priest, to all the other priests who assisted him, and to the men who guarded the entrance to the temple. He told them to bring out from the temple all the items that people had been using to worship Baal, the goddess Asherah, and the stars. After they carried them out, they burned all those things outside the city in the Kidron Valley. Then they took all the ashes to Bethel."},{"number":5,"verse":"There were many pagan priests whom the previous kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense on the altars scattered throughout the region of Judah and to worship on the high places that were build on the hills.

The king stopped them from doing those things."},{"number":6,"verse":"He commanded that the statue of the goddess Asherah be taken out of the temple.

He also desecrated the places on the hills where the priests had burned incense to honor idols, from Geba in the north to Beersheba in the south. Those priests were not allowed to offer sacrifices in the temple, but they were allowed to eat the unleavened bread that the priests who worked in the temple ate.

Those altars were at the left of the main gate into the city."},{"number":10,"verse":"Josiah also desecrated the place named Topheth, in the Ben Hinnom Valley, in order that no one could offer his son or daughter there to be completely burned on the altar as a sacrifice to the god Molech."},{"number":11,"verse":"He also removed the horses that the previous kings of Judah had dedicated to worshiping the sun, and he burned the chariots that were used in that worship.

He commanded that they be smashed to pieces and thrown down into the Kidron Valley."},{"number":13,"verse":"He also commanded that the altars that King Solomon had built east of Jerusalem, south of the Mount of Olives—the so-called Mount of Corruption—be desecrated.

Josiah led the people of Israel to tear down that altar that was on the high hill, and they also burned the wooden pole used in the worship of the idol that had the name \"Asherah.\""},{"number":16,"verse":"Then Josiah looked around and saw some tombs on the hill. He commanded his men to take the bones out of those tombs and burn them on the altar. By doing that, he desecrated the altar. These events were predicted many years before when Yahweh gave his word to Israel by his prophet."},{"number":17,"verse":"Josiah asked, \"Whose tomb is that?\" The people of Bethel replied, \"It is the tomb of the prophet who came from Judah and predicted that these things that you have just now done to this altar would happen.\""},{"number":18,"verse":"Josiah replied, \"Allow his tomb to remain as it is. Do not remove the prophet's bones from the tomb.\" So the people did not remove those bones, or the bones of the other prophet, the one who had come from Samaria."},{"number":19,"verse":"In every city in Israel, at Josiah's command, they tore down the houses build on hills to worship idols. The ones that had been built by the previous kings of Israel, which had caused Yahweh to become very angry. He did to all those places of idols worship the same thing that he had done to the altars at Bethel."},{"number":20,"verse":"He ordered that all the priests who offered sacrifices on the places built on the hills where they worshiped idols, and they were to be killed on those altars.
