Perhaps the Spirit of Yahweh has left him on some mountain or in some valley.\" Elisha replied, \"No, do not send them.\""},{"number":17,"verse":"But they continued to urge him. Finally he was tired of saying \"No, \"and he said, \"Very well, send them.\" So fifty men searched for three days, but they did not find Elijah."},{"number":18,"verse":"They returned to Jericho, and Elisha was still there. He said to them, \"I told you that you should not go, because you would not find him!\""},{"number":19,"verse":"Then the leaders of Jericho came to talk with Elisha. One of them said, \"Our master, we have a problem. You can see that this is a very nice place to live in.

They continued shouting, \"Go away, you bald-headed man!\""},{"number":24,"verse":"Elisha turned around and reprimanded them in the name of Yahweh. Immediately two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of them."},{"number":25,"verse":"Elisha left Bethel and went to Mount Carmel, and after that he returned to the city of Samaria."}]}
