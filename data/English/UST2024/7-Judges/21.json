Why has this happened to us?"},{"number":4,"verse":"Early the next morning the people built an altar. Then they completely burned some sacrifices on the altar, and also offered other sacrifices to restore fellowship with God."},{"number":5,"verse":"Then, because they had solemnly declared that anyone who did not meet with them at Mizpah to help fight the men of the tribe of Benjamin would be killed, they asked among themselves, \"Were there any of the tribes of Israel who did not come to Mizpah to meet with us in the presence of Yahweh?\""},{"number":6,"verse":"The Israelites felt sorry for their fellow Israelites from the tribe of Benjamin.

Where can we get women to be wives of the men who are still alive?"},{"number":17,"verse":"These men must have wives to give birth to children, in order that their families of Benjamin will continue. If that does not happen, all the people of one of the tribes of Israel will all die out, and the tribe will be destroyed."},{"number":18,"verse":"But we cannot allow our daughters to marry these men, because we solemnly declared that Yahweh will curse anyone who gives one of his daughters to become a wife of any man of the tribe of Benjamin.\""},{"number":19,"verse":"Then they had an idea. They said, \"Every year there is a festival to honor Yahweh at Shiloh, which is north of Bethel and east of the road that extends from Bethel to Shechem, and it is south of the city of Lebonah.\""},{"number":20,"verse":"So the Israelite leaders told the men of the tribe of Benjamin, \"When it is the time for that festival, go to Shiloh and hide in the vineyards."},{"number":21,"verse":"Keep watching for the young women to come out of the city to dance. When they come out, run out of the vineyards. Each of you can seize one of the young women of Shiloh. Then you can all return to your homes with those women."},{"number":22,"verse":"If their fathers or brothers come to us and complain about what you have done, we will say to them, 'Act kindly toward the men of the tribe of Benjamin. When we fought them, we did not leave any women alive to become their wives, and you did not give those young women to the men from the tribe of Benjamin. They stole them. So you will not be guilty, even though you said that you would not give any of your daughters to marry one of them.'\""},{"number":23,"verse":"So that is what the men of the tribe of Benjamin did. They went to Shiloh at the time of the festival. And when the young women were dancing, each man caught one of them and took her away and married her. Then they took their wives back to the land that God had given to them. They rebuilt their cities that had been burned down, and they lived there."},{"number":24,"verse":"The other Israelites went to their home in the areas where their tribes and clans lived, the areas that God had allotted to them."},{"number":25,"verse":"At that time, the Israelite people did not have a king. Everyone did what was right according to his own opinion."}]}
