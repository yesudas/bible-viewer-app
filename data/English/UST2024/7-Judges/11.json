When they grew up, they forced Jephthah to leave home, saying to him, \"You are the son of another woman, not the son of our mother. So when our father dies, you will not receive any of his property.\""},{"number":3,"verse":"So Jephthah ran away from his brothers, and he lived in the land of Tob. While he was there, some lawless men joined together with Jepthah, and they came and went with each other."},{"number":4,"verse":"Some time later, the soldiers of Ammon attacked the soldiers of Israel."},{"number":5,"verse":"And the leaders of the Gilead went out to find Jephthah so they could bring him back, and away from the land of Tob."},{"number":6,"verse":"They said to him, \"Come with us and lead our army, and help us fight the army of Ammon!\""},{"number":7,"verse":"But Jephthah replied, \"You hated me! You forced me to leave my father's house!

Come and fight with us and lead our soldiers against the soldiers of Ammon, and you will be the leader over everyone who lives in Gilead.\""},{"number":9,"verse":"Jephthah answered them, \"If I go back to Gilead with you to fight against the army of Ammon, and if Yahweh helps us to defeat them, then I will be your leader.\""},{"number":10,"verse":"They replied, \"Yahweh is a witness to everything we are saying to you.

And Jephthah repeated to Yahweh there at Mizpah the terms of the agreement he had made."},{"number":12,"verse":"Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammon people group. They asked the king, \"What have we done to make you angry, so your army is coming to fight against the people in our land?\""},{"number":13,"verse":"The king replied, \"You took our land when you came here from Egypt. You took all our land east of the Jordan River, from the Arnon River in the south to the Jabbok River in the north.

So the Israelites stayed at Kadesh for a long time."},{"number":18,"verse":"Then the Israelites went into the desert and walked outside the borders of the Edom and Moab. They walked east of Moab, and then north of the Arnon River, which is the northern border of Moab. They did not cross into the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab."},{"number":19,"verse":"Then the leaders of Israel sent a message to Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon. They asked him, \"Please allow us Israelite people to cross through your land so we may go into the land that is ours.\""},{"number":20,"verse":"But Sihon did not trust the Israelites to pass through his land in peace.

And we will live in the land that Yahweh our God has given to us!"},{"number":25,"verse":"Are you better than Balak son of Zippor, the king of the Moab? He never dared to fight against Israel!"},{"number":26,"verse":"For three hundred years the Israelites lived in the cities of Heshbon and Aroer, in the surrounding towns, and in all the cities along the Arnon River. Why have you Ammonites not taken back those cities during all those years?"},{"number":27,"verse":"We have not done wrong against you, but you are doing wrong against me by attacking me and my army. I trust that Yahweh, who is the judge, will decide whether the people of Israel or the people of Ammon are in the right.'\""},{"number":28,"verse":"But the king of the Ammon ignored the warning contained in this message from Jephthah."},{"number":29,"verse":"Then the Spirit of Yahweh took control of Jephthah.

She was joyfully playing a tambourine and dancing. She was his only child and he had no other sons or daughters."},{"number":35,"verse":"When Jephthah saw his daughter, he tore his clothes to show that he was very sad about what he was going to do. He said to her, \"My daughter, seeing you now, you have crushed me with a terrible sorrow, because I made a solemn promise to Yahweh to sacrifice the first one who came out of my house, and I must do what I promised.\""},{"number":36,"verse":"His daughter said, \"My father, you made a solemn promise to Yahweh. So you must do to me what you promised, because you said that you would do that if Yahweh helped you to defeat our enemies, the Ammonites.\""},{"number":37,"verse":"Then she also said, \"But allow me to do one thing. First, allow me to go into the hills and wander around for two months. Since I will never be married and have children, allow me and my friends to go and cry together.\""},{"number":38,"verse":"Jephthah replied, \"All right, you may go.\" So she left for two months. She and her friends stayed in the hills and they cried for her because she would never be married."},{"number":39,"verse":"After two months, she returned to her father Jephthah, and he did to her what he had solemnly promised. So his daughter never was married. Because of that, the Israelites now have a custom."},{"number":40,"verse":"Every year the young Israelite women go into the hills for four days to remember and cry about what happened to the daughter of Jephthah."}]}
