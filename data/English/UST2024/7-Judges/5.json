Pay attention, you leaders! I will sing to Yahweh. With this song I will praise Yahweh, the God of Israel."},{"number":4,"verse":"O Yahweh, when you came from Seir, when you marched from that land, also known as Edom, the earth shook, and rain poured down from the skies."},{"number":5,"verse":"The mountains shook when you came, just like Mount Sinai shook when you appeared there, because you are Yahweh, the God of Israel."},{"number":6,"verse":"When Shamgar was our leader and in the days of Jael, we were afraid to walk on the main roads; instead, caravans of travelers walked on winding, less traveled roads to avoid being molested."},{"number":7,"verse":"There were few warriors willing to fight in Israel until I, Deborah, became their leader. I became like a mother to the Israelite people."},{"number":8,"verse":"When the Israelite people abandoned Yahweh and chose new gods, enemies attacked the gates of the cities, and then they took away the shields and spears from forty thousand Israelite soldiers.

These were men who belonged to Yahweh and they came down to me to fight their enemies alongside these warriors."},{"number":14,"verse":"Some came from the tribe descended from Ephraim. They came from land that once belonged to the descendants of Amalek. Men from the tribe descended from Benjamin followed them. Troops from the group descended from Machir also came down, and officers from the tribe descended from Zebulun came down, carrying staffs to show they were important."},{"number":15,"verse":"Leaders from the tribes descended from Issachar joined Barak and me. They followed Barak, rushing down into the valley. But men from the tribe descended from Reuben could not decide what they should do."},{"number":16,"verse":"Why did you men stay at your fireplaces, waiting to hear the shepherds whistle for their flocks of sheep to come to the pens? Men in the tribe descended from Reuben could not decide whether they would join us to fight our enemies, or not."},{"number":17,"verse":"Similarly, the men living in the Gilead area stayed at home, east of the Jordan River. And the men from the tribe descended from Dan, why did they stay home? The tribe descended from Asher sat by the seashore.

She brought him some yogurt in a bowl that was suitable for kings."},{"number":26,"verse":"Then, when he was asleep, she reached for a tent peg with her left hand, and she reached for a hammer with her right hand. She hit Sisera hard with it and crushed his head. She pounded the tent peg right through his head."},{"number":27,"verse":"He collapsed at her feet and he fell and he layed there and did not move. At her feet he sank down, and there he fell limp. He was dead."},{"number":28,"verse":"Sisera's mother looked out from her window. She waited for him to return. She said, 'Why is he taking so long to come home in his chariot? Why do I not hear the sound of the wheels of his chariot?'"},{"number":29,"verse":"Her wisest princesses replied to her, and she kept consoling herself by repeating those words:"},{"number":30,"verse":"'Perhaps they are dividing up the things and the people they captured after the battle. Each soldier will get one or two women who will bear them children. Sisera will get some beautiful robes, and some beautiful embroidered robes for me.'"},{"number":31,"verse":"But that is not what happened! Yahweh, I hope that all your enemies will die as Sisera did! And I desire that all those who love you, Yahweh, be as strong as the sun when it rises!\" There was peace again in the land for forty years."}]}
