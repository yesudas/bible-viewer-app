{"bibleAbbr":"UST2024","bookName":"1 Timothy","bookEnglishName":"1 Timothy","chapterNumber":5,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"Do not speak harshly to a man older than yourself. Instead, advise him as if he were your father. Do the same to younger men as if they were your brothers."},{"number":2,"verse":"Advise older women as mothers, and younger women as if they were your sisters. You must act in a completely proper way as you do that."},{"number":3,"verse":"Respect widows who are true widows."},{"number":4,"verse":"But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn that they are to care for their own family first. They should repay their parents and grandparents for all that they did for them when they were young, because doing that pleases God."},{"number":5,"verse":"The widow who is really alone and have no one to help her confidently expects that God will help her. So night and day she prays and earnestly asks God to help her and others."},{"number":6,"verse":"But a widow who lives for how she can please herself is spiritually dead, even though she is still physically alive."},{"number":7,"verse":"You should announce these things so that no one can criticize the believers."},{"number":8,"verse":"If anyone does not take care of his own relatives, and especially those who live in his own house, he has rejected what we believe and we should consider that he is worse than a person who does not believe in the Messiah."},{"number":9,"verse":"Put a woman on the list of true widows only if she is more than sixty years old. She also must have had only one husband, to whom she had been faithful."},{"number":10,"verse":"People must know that she does good deeds: Perhaps she cared for children well; perhaps she welcomed strangers; perhaps she helped the believers; perhaps she helped people who were suffering; or perhaps she is known for doing a large variety of good things."},{"number":11,"verse":"But do not put younger widows on the widows' list, because they often want to marry again when they change their minds and put married love ahead of the Messiah."},{"number":12,"verse":"When they do this, then they become guilty of going back on their prior commitment to being widows."},{"number":13,"verse":"At the same time, they also go from house to house and get into the habit of doing nothing. In addition, they also begin to talk about people and to meddle in other people's affairs and to say things that they should not say."},{"number":14,"verse":"So I prefer that younger widows get married, have children, and manage their homes well, so they give Satan, the enemy, no opportunity to accuse them of doing wrong."},{"number":15,"verse":"I write these things because some younger widows have already stopped obeying the Messiah in order to obey Satan."},{"number":16,"verse":"If any believing woman has widows among her relatives, let her help them, so those widows will not be a burden to the church. In this way the church will be able to help real widows."},{"number":17,"verse":"Let the believers give double honor to the elders who lead them well, and especially to the elders who work hard at preaching and teaching."},{"number":18,"verse":"For the scripture says, \"You shall not keep the ox from eating the grain that he is treading out\" and\" The laborer deserves to get his pay.\""},{"number":19,"verse":"Do not listen to anyone who accuses an elder of doing wrong, unless two or three people testify about the matter."},{"number":20,"verse":"Those who continue to sin, correct them where everyone can see you, so that the rest of the people will be afraid to sin."},{"number":21,"verse":"God and the Messiah Jesus and the chosen angels see me as I solemnly command you to do these things. Do not judge anyone before you should. Do not favor one person over another."},{"number":22,"verse":"Do not be in a hurry to put your hands on a man to appoint him as an elder. God will consider that you are responsible if you approve as an elder a person who sins. You must keep yourself without fault."},{"number":23,"verse":"No longer drink only water, Timothy. Instead, drink a little wine, because that may cure your frequent stomach sicknesses."},{"number":24,"verse":"The sins of some people are clear to everyone, which makes it easy to judge them. But the sins of other people are hidden until later."},{"number":25,"verse":"In the same way, some good deeds are clear to everybody, but even the other good deeds will become clear at some time in the future."}]}
