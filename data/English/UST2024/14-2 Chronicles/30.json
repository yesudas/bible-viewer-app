This is what they wrote: \"You Israelite people, you who survived after being slaves of the kings of Assyria, return to Yahweh, the God whom our great ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob worshiped, in order that he may return to you. Your fathers and your fellow countrymen did not faithfully obey Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped."},{"number":7,"verse":"Do not act like they did, because what they did caused Yahweh to punish them so severely that other people were horrified when they heard of what he had done."},{"number":8,"verse":"Do not be stubborn as our ancestors were.
