They said to themselves, \"Why should allow the king of Assyria and his army to come and find plenty of water to drink?\" So they decided to stop the water from flowing outside the city. A large group of men gathered together and blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through that area."},{"number":5,"verse":"Then they worked hard to repair all the sections of the city wall that had been broken, and they built watchtowers on the walls higher. They strengthened the Millo, a massive supporting wall on the east side of the city of David. They also made a large number of weapons and shields."},{"number":6,"verse":"Hezekiah appointed army commanders, and he gathered them in front of him in the square at one of the city gates, and he encouraged them by saying this to them:"},{"number":7,"verse":"\"Be strong and courageous.

We destroyed them all, and their gods could not save them from me."},{"number":15,"verse":"So do not allow Hezekiah to deceive you like this. Do not believe what he says, because no god of any nation or kingdom has ever been able to rescue his people from being conquered by my army and the armies of my ancestors.

So the king of Assyria left, and returned to his own country, very disgraced. And one day when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons struck him with their swords and killed him."},{"number":22,"verse":"That is how Yahweh guided and rescued Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the power of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, and from the power of all their other enemies. That is how he gave them peace with all the countries near them."},{"number":23,"verse":"Many people brought offerings for Yahweh to Jerusalem, and also brought valuable gifts for King Hezekiah.

But he prayed to Yahweh, and Yahweh answered him. He performed a miracle and healed Hezekiah."},{"number":25,"verse":"But Hezekiah was very proud, and he did not thank Yahweh for acting kindly toward him. Therefore Yahweh was angry with him and punished him and the people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah."},{"number":26,"verse":"Then Hezekiah said that he was sorry about being proud, and the people of Jerusalem also said that they were sorry for their sins. So Yahweh did not punishthem during the remaining years that Hezekiah was their king."},{"number":27,"verse":"Hezekiah became very rich and was greatly honored.
