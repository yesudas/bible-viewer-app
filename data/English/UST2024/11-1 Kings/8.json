Then the descendants of Levi who assisted the priests helped them to carry to the temple the sacred tent and all the sacred things that had been in the tent."},{"number":5,"verse":"Then King Solomon and many of the Israelite people gathered in front of Yahweh's sacred chest. And they sacrificed a huge amount of sheep and oxen. No one was able to count the sacrifices because there were very many."},{"number":6,"verse":"Then the priests brought the sacred chest into the very holy place in the temple, and they placed it under the wings of the statues of the winged creatures."},{"number":7,"verse":"The wings of those statues spread out over the sacred chest and over the poles by which it was carried."},{"number":8,"verse":"The poles were very long, with the result that the ends of the poles could be seen by people who were standing at the entrance to the very holy place, but they could not be seen by people standing outside the temple. Those poles are still there."},{"number":9,"verse":"The only things that were in the sacred chest were the two stone tablets that Moses had put there at Mount Sinai, where Yahweh made a covenant with the people after they left Egypt."},{"number":10,"verse":"The priests put the sacred chest in the temple.

By his own power he has done what he promised to my father David. What he promised was this:"},{"number":16,"verse":"From the time that I brought my people out of Egypt, I have never chosen any city in Israel in which a temple should be built for my people to worship me there. But I chose you, David, to rule my people.\""},{"number":17,"verse":"Then Solomon said, \"My father David wanted to build a temple in order that we Israelite people could worship Yahweh our God there."},{"number":18,"verse":"But Yahweh said to him, 'You have wanted to build a temple for me, and what you wanted to do was good."},{"number":19,"verse":"However, you are not the one who I want to build it. It is one of your sons who I want to build a temple for me.'"},{"number":20,"verse":"And now Yahweh has done what he promised to do. I have become the king of Israel to succeed my father, and I am ruling my people, as Yahweh promised. I have arranged for this temple to be built for us Israelites to worship Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong."},{"number":21,"verse":"I have also provided a place in the temple for the sacred chest in which are the two stone tablets of the covenant that Yahweh made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt.\""},{"number":22,"verse":"Then Solomon stood in front of the altar which was in front of the Israelite people who had gathered there.

You told him that there would always be some of his descendants who would be kings in Israel, if they would conduct their lives as he did."},{"number":26,"verse":"So now, God of us Israelite people, cause what you promised to do for my father David, who served you well, to happen."},{"number":27,"verse":"But God, will you really live on the earth among people? There is not enough space in heaven for you to have enough space to live there. So this temple that I have commanded my workers to build is certainly too small for you to live in."},{"number":28,"verse":"But Yahweh, my God, please listen to me while I am praying to you this day."},{"number":29,"verse":"I pray that you would protect this temple night and day. This is the place about which you have said, 'I will always be there.'

Then they will know that this temple that I have caused to be built to honor you belongs to you and is where you should be worshiped."},{"number":44,"verse":"Suppose that you send your people to go to fight against their enemies. And suppose that your people pray to you, wherever they are, and that they turn toward this city that you have chosen and toward this temple that I have caused to be built for you."},{"number":45,"verse":"In that case, listen in heaven to their prayers. Listen to what they plead for you to do, and assist them."},{"number":46,"verse":"It is true that everyone sins. So, suppose that your people sin against you and that you become angry with them. You might allow their enemies to defeat them, capture them, and take them away to their own countries, even to countries that are far away."},{"number":47,"verse":"And suppose that, while your people are in those countries to which they had to go, they sincerely repent and plead with you there saying, 'We have sinned and have done things that are very wicked.'"},{"number":48,"verse":"Suppose that they very truly and sincerely repent, and turn toward this land that you gave to our ancestors.

Then the king and all the people dedicated the temple."},{"number":64,"verse":"On that day, the king also dedicated the middle part of the courtyard that was in front of the temple. Then he offered there sacrifices that would be completely burned on the altar, the offerings of flour and the fat of the animals that were sacrificed to restore fellowship with Yahweh. They sacrificed them there because the bronze altar was not big enough for all those sacrifices to be burned on it that day."},{"number":65,"verse":"Then Solomon and all the Israelite people celebrated the Festival of Shelters for seven days and then for another seven days, for a total of fourteen days. There was a huge crowd of people there, some of whom had come from distant places like Hamath in the far north and the border of Egypt in the far south."},{"number":66,"verse":"On the final day, Solomon sent the people to their homes.
