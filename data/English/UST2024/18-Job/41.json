Will they cut a crocodile up into pieces and sell the meat?"},{"number":7,"verse":"Can you pierce crocodiles through their hides by throwing fishing spears at them? Can you pierce their heads with a harpoon?"},{"number":8,"verse":"If you grab one of them with your hands, it will give you a battle that you will never forget, and you will never try to do it again!"},{"number":9,"verse":"It is useless to even hope to subdue them. Anyone who tries to subdue one of them will fall to the ground out of fear."},{"number":10,"verse":"No one dares to make a crocodile angry.
