He would ask Yahweh to purify them from any action they might have committed during their feasting that would make them unacceptable to him. He would get up early in the morning, kill animals, and burn them on the altar as sacrifices, one for each of his children.

They killed all your servants who were working in the fields and took away all the oxen and donkeys!

Then he laid down on the ground to worship God."},{"number":21,"verse":"He said, \"When I was born, I was wearing no clothes. When I die, I will not take any clothes with me. It is Yahweh who gave me everything that I possessed, and it is Yahweh who has taken it all away. But we must always praise Yahweh!\""},{"number":22,"verse":"So in spite of all the things that happened to Job, he did speak not like a foolish manâ€”he did not sin by saying that what God had done was wrong."}]}
