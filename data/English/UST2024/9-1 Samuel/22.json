David has rebelled against me, and right now he is hiding somewhere, waiting to attack me.\""},{"number":14,"verse":"Ahimelech replied, \"I do not understand why you are saying that, because David, your son-in-law, the captain of your bodyguards, is very loyal to you. No one is more loyal to you than David! Everyone in your household respects him very much."},{"number":15,"verse":"Furthermore, this was certainly not the first time that I requested God to say what he wanted David to do.
