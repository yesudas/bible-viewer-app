His name was Hiram."},{"number":2,"verse":"There he met a woman who was the daughter of a man from Canaan land named Shua. He married her and slept with her."},{"number":3,"verse":"She became pregnant and later gave birth to a son.

So marry his widow and sleep with her. That is what our customs require that you should do.\""},{"number":9,"verse":"But Onan knew if he did that, any children who would be born would not be considered to be his. So every time he slept with his brother's widow, he spilled his semen on the ground, so that she would not get pregnant and produce children for his older brother."},{"number":10,"verse":"Yahweh considered that what he did was wicked, so he caused him to die also."},{"number":11,"verse":"Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, \"Return to your father's house, but do not marry anyone else. When my youngest son Shelah grows up, he can marry you.\" But Judah really did not want Shelah to marry her, because he was afraid that then Shelah would die too, just as his older brothers had died. So Tamar obeyed Judah and went back to live in her father's house again."},{"number":12,"verse":"Several years later, Judah's wife, who was the daughter of Shua, died.

Then she sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah."},{"number":15,"verse":"When Judah came along and saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, because she had covered her head and sat where prostitutes often sat."},{"number":16,"verse":"Judah did not realize that she was his daughter-in-law. So he said to her, \"Let me sleep with you.\" She replied, \"What will you give me in exchange?\""},{"number":17,"verse":"He replied, \"I will send you a young goat from my flock of goats.\" She asked, \"Will you give me something now for me to keep until you send the goat?\""},{"number":18,"verse":"He replied, \"What do you want me to give to you?\" She replied, \"Give me the ring that has your name on it that is tied by a cord around your neck, and give me the walking stick that you are holding in your hand.\" So he gave them to her.

Whose are they?\""},{"number":26,"verse":"When the man did that, Judah recognized the ring and the stick. He said, \"She is more right than I am. I did not tell my son Shelah to marry her, as I promised that I would.\" And Judah did not sleep with her again."},{"number":27,"verse":"When it was time for her to give birth, she was surprised that there were twin boys in her womb."},{"number":28,"verse":"As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand. So the midwife fastened a scarlet thread around his wrist, saying, \"This one came out first.\""},{"number":29,"verse":"But he pulled his hand back inside the womb, and his brother came out first.
