Will you really destroy them all, and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people who have done nothing wrong?"},{"number":25,"verse":"Certainly you would not do such a thing, to kill good people along with wicked ones, and treat good people and wicked people the same way.

What will you do if there are only thirty good people?\" He replied, \"I will not do it if I find that there are thirty there.\""},{"number":31,"verse":"Abraham said, \"I should not be bold and speak to you like this, my Lord. But what will you do if you find that there are only twenty good people there?\" He replied, \"I will not destroy the whole city, for the sake of those twenty.\""},{"number":32,"verse":"Finally, Abraham said, \"My Lord, do not be angry now. Just let me speak one time more.
