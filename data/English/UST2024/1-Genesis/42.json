You are spies!"},{"number":15,"verse":"But this is how I will find out whether what you are saying is true. I think that as surely as the king lives, you are spies. So you will not leave this place until your youngest brother comes here!"},{"number":16,"verse":"Send one of your group to go and get your younger brother and bring him here. I will put the rest of you in prison, in order that I may test what you have said to find out whether what you are telling me is true.

But he knew that he could not keep from crying, and he did not want them to see him crying, so he left them and went outside the room and began to cry.
