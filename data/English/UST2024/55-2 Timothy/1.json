{"bibleAbbr":"UST2024","bookName":"2 Timothy","bookEnglishName":"2 Timothy","chapterNumber":1,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"I, Paul, am writing this letter. I am an apostle because the Messiah Jesus chose me to do what God wanted. God has promised me that the Messiah Jesus will cause me to live both now and forever. (1)I, Paul, write this letter to you, Titus. I am a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus the Messiah. God sent me to teach the people whom he has chosen as his own to trust him more. I work to help his people to know what is true, so that they can live in a way that pleases God."},{"number":2,"verse":"I am writing to you, Timothy, whom I love as if you were my own son. May God our Father and the Messiah Jesus our Lord act kindly and mercifully and peacefully toward you. (2)His people can learn how to live like this because they are confident that God will cause them to live forever. God does not lie. Even before the world began, he promised to cause us to live forever."},{"number":3,"verse":"I thank God and I serve Him because I truly want to do what he wants, just as my ancestors did. I have always remembered to pray for you, Timothy, night and day. (3)Then, at the right time, he communicated his plan through this message that he trusted me to preach. I do this in order to obey the command of God, who saves us."},{"number":4,"verse":"I really want to see you because I remember how you cried when we separated. If I see you again, I will rejoice so much. (4)I am writing to you, Titus; you have become like a real son to me because we both now believe in Jesus the Messiah. May God the Father and the Messiah Jesus who saves us continue to be kind to you and to give you a peaceful spirit."},{"number":5,"verse":"I remember that you truly believe in Jesus! First, your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice in Jesus, and I am sure that you also believe in him! (5)I left you on the Island of Crete for this reason: that you do the work that is still unfinished and also appoint elders for the group of believers in every city, just as I told you to do."},{"number":6,"verse":"Because I am sure that you believe in him, I remind you to start using again the gift God gave you. You have this gift because I put my hands on you to show that he had chosen you to do his work. (6)Now every elder must be someone whom no one can criticize. He must also have just one wife, his children must trust in God, and people must not consider his children to be out of control or disobedient."},{"number":7,"verse":"God did not give us his Spirit to cause us to be afraid; instead, he caused us to have power to obey God, to love him and others, and to control ourselves. (7)Everyone who leads God's people is like someone who manages God's house. So it is necessary for this person to have a good reputation. He should not be proud and he must not get angry quickly. He must not be an alcoholic, not someone who likes to fight and argue, and not a greedy man."},{"number":8,"verse":"So do not be ashamed to tell people about our Lord. do not be ashamed of me, even though I am a prisoner because I preach about him. Instead, be willing to suffer hardship as you tell others about the good news. God will make you able to suffer these hardships. (8)Rather than that, he must welcome strangers and love the things that are good. He must always act sensibly and treat other people in a fair and honest manner. He must always act in a way that is right for someone who is devoted to God and he must always control his emotions."},{"number":9,"verse":"He will do this because he saved us and called us to be his own people. God did not save us because of any good works we did. Instead, even before the world began, he saved us because he planned to be kind to us as a result or what Jesus the Messiah would do for us. (9)He must always believe the true things we have taught him, and he must live according to them. He must do this in order to persuade people to live like this too, and in order to correct people if they do not want to live like this."},{"number":10,"verse":"Now, as a result of our Savior the Messiah Jesus having come, everyone can see that he acts kindly toward us. Specifically, he has declared that we will not remain dead after we die! But he has shown us that because we believed the good news about the Messiah, we will live forever in bodies that will not decay! (10)I tell you these things because there are many people who refuse to obey those who are in authority over them. What these people say has no value. They persuade people to believe wrong things. The people who are the most like this are the ones who tell all followers of the Messiah to become circumcised."},{"number":11,"verse":"God decided to send me to be preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of this good news. (11)You and the leaders whom you appoint should prevent such people from teaching the believers. They are teaching things that they should not teach, causing entire families to believe wrong things. They only do it so that people will give them money. This is very shameful!"},{"number":12,"verse":"So, I suffer here in this prison, but I am not ashamed of being here, because I know the Messiah Jesus, the one whom I have trusted. I am convinced that he is able to keep safe the good message that he has entrusted to me until the day when he returns. (12)One man of Crete, someone his people thought was a prophet, said, \" Cretans are always lying to one another! They are like dangerous wild animals! They are lazy and always eat too much food.\""},{"number":13,"verse":"Be sure that you tell others the same correct message that you heard from me. And as you tell it, keep trusting in the Messiah Jesus and keep loving others as the Messiah Jesus enables you to do. (13)What he said is true, so correct them forcefully so that they may believe and teach correct things about God."},{"number":14,"verse":"Do not alter the good message that God has entrusted to you. Allow the Holy Spirit who lives in us to direct what you say. (14)They should stop living according to stories invented by the Jews and commandments that came from people, not God, people who have stopped obeying what is true."},{"number":15,"verse":"You know that almost all the believers in Asia have stopped being friends with me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. (15)If some people do not have sinful thoughts or desires, then for those people everything is good. But if people are wicked and do not believe in the Messiah Jesus, everything that they do makes them unclean. Such people's way of thinking has been ruined. They do not even feel guilty when they do what is evil."},{"number":16,"verse":"May the Lord be kind to the family of Onesiphorus, because he often helped me, and he was not ashamed that I am in prison. (16)Even though they claim to know God, what they do shows that they do not know him. They are disgusting. They disobey God and can do nothing good for him."},{"number":17,"verse":"On the contrary, when he came here to Rome, he kept searching for me until he found me."},{"number":18,"verse":"May the Lord be kind to Onesiphorus in that day when he, the Lord, will judge people. And how much he served me in Ephesus, you know very well."}]}
