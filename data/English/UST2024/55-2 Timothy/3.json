{"bibleAbbr":"UST2024","bookName":"2 Timothy","bookEnglishName":"2 Timothy","chapterNumber":3,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"You need to realize that during the last days before the Messiah returns, it will be very dangerous. (1)Titus, be sure to remind our people that, as much as possible, they should comply with the rules and laws that govern our society. They need to be obedient and ready to do good whenever they are able."},{"number":2,"verse":"People will love themselves more than anyone else. They will love money. They will boast about themselves. They will be proud. They will insult others. They will not obey their parents. They will not thank anyone for anything. They will not honor God. (2)They should not say disrespectful things about anyone or argue with people. They should treat everyone gently and as more important than themselves."},{"number":3,"verse":"They will not love others. They will refuse to be at peace with anyone. They will slander others. They will not control themselves. They will be brutal toward others. They will hate anything that is good. (3)We need to remember that there was a time when we ourselves were foolish and unpersuaded about these things. Our own passions and our desire for pleasure took us in the wrong direction and we served them as if we were their slaves. We were constantly envying each other and doing evil. We caused people to hate us and we hated each other."},{"number":4,"verse":"They will betray the ones they should protect. They will do dangerous things without thinking. They will be proud, and they will do what pleases them instead of loving God. (4)But when God showed us that he was acting generously to save us because he loves us,"},{"number":5,"verse":"They will seem to honor God, but they will refuse to accept the power that God gives to those who honor him. Stay away from people like this. (5)he saved us by washing us clean on the inside, giving us a new birth, and making us new by the Holy Spirit. He did not save us because we do good things, but he saved us because he is merciful."},{"number":6,"verse":"These men enter into the homes of foolish women deceive those women so that they control what they think. These are women who sin all the time, so they follow these evil men into doing all sorts of bad things that they enjoy doing. (6)God generously gave us his Holy Spirit when Jesus the Messiah saved us."},{"number":7,"verse":"Even though these women are always wanting to learn new things, they are never able to learn what is actually true. (7)By this gift, God has declared that everything is made right between him and us. He gave us the Holy Spirit so that we can share in everything that the Lord Jesus has to give us, especially everlasting life with him."},{"number":8,"verse":"In the same way that Jannes and Jambres tried to stop Moses, so do these men now try to stop people from obeying the truth. These men are ruined in how they think. They are frauds in matters of the faith. (8)This is a statement that can be trusted. I want you to continually emphasize these things so that those who have believed God may constantly devote themselves to doing those things that are good and that help others. These things are excellent and beneficial for everyone."},{"number":9,"verse":"Nevertheless, they will not succeed very much in what they do, because most others will clearly see that these people understand nothing. It is just like how the people of Israel saw that Jannes and Jambres were foolish. (9)But stay away from senseless debates, controversies about lists of Jewish ancestors, and arguments and disputes about religious law. Those kinds of discussions are useless and they do not help you in any way."},{"number":10,"verse":"Timothy, you have followed what I taught you. You have seen my way of living. You have seen how I want to serve God. You have seen how I trust in him. You have seen how I have peace even when I am suffering. You have seen how I love God and the believers. You have seen how I keep on serving God even when it is very hard to do so. (10)If people insist on engaging in these divisive activities after you have warned them one or two times, then have nothing more to do with them,"},{"number":11,"verse":"You have seen how people persecuted me, such as how I suffered when I was in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I suffered very much in those places, but the Lord has taken me out of all that suffering. (11)because you know that people like that have turned away from the truth; they are sinning and condemn themselves."},{"number":12,"verse":"Indeed, they will make suffer all the believers who want to live in a way that they honor the Messiah Jesus. (12)When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at the town of Nicopolis, because I have decided to stay there for the winter."},{"number":13,"verse":"Evil men and frauds will continue to become more evil. They will lead people away from what is true, and they will allow others to lead themselves away also. (13)Do everything you can to send Zenas the law expert and Apollos on their journey, along with everything that they need."},{"number":14,"verse":"But you, in contrast, must continue to believe what you have learned and firmly believe. I know that you are confident about these things because I am one of the people who taught you these things. (14)Make sure that our people learn to occupy themselves in the same way with doing good things for people who need help. If they do this they will be living in a useful way for God."},{"number":15,"verse":"From the time when you were a child you have known what God says in the scriptures. These enabled you to understand how God saves us when we trust in the Messiah Jesus. (15)Titus, all those who are with me greet you! Please greet our friends there who love us as fellow believers. May God continue to show great kindness to all of you."},{"number":16,"verse":"All the scriptures come from God's Spirit, so we should read them in order to teach the truth about God. We should also read them in order to persuade people to believe the truth. Also to correct people when they sin. Also to teach people how to do what is right."},{"number":17,"verse":"The scriptures are useful to help the believer who serves God to have everything he needs to do every kind of good deed."}]}
