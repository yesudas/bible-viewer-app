Now she wants to sell her right to the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelek."},{"number":4,"verse":"I thought that I should tell you about that, and suggest that you buy it, while these elders who are sitting here are listening. If you are willing to buy the property, do that. But if you do not want to buy it, tell me, so that I will know. I am suggesting this to you because you are the one who has the first right to buy it, and if you do not buy it, I am next in line.\" The man replied, \"I will buy it!\""},{"number":5,"verse":"Then Boaz told him, \"When you buy the land from Naomi, you will also need to marry Ruth, our relative's widow from Moab, in order that she may have a son to inherit the property and carry on the name of her dead husband.\""},{"number":6,"verse":"Then the nearer relative said, \"If that is so, I do not want to buy the property, because then my own children would not inherit the property.

This is in order that she may give birth to a son who will inherit the property. In this way he will carry on the family name among his relatives and here in his hometown. Today you all are witnesses of what I have done.\""},{"number":11,"verse":"All the elders and the others who were sitting at the town gate agreed and said, \"Yes, we are witnesses.\" One of them added, \"May Yahweh allow this woman, who will be coming into your home, to be like Rachel and Leah, the two who bore our ancestors and started our people, Israel. We hope that you will become rich in the clan of Ephrathah, and become famous here in Bethlehem."},{"number":12,"verse":"May your family be like the family of your ancestor Perez son of Judah, and Tamar, because of the many descendants that Yahweh will give to you and this young woman.\""},{"number":13,"verse":"So Boaz took Ruth to be his wife and slept with her.
