Tell the people of Judah that they should be afraid and tremble, because it will soon be the time for Yahweh to punish us further."},{"number":2,"verse":"That will be a very dark and gloomy day; there will be black clouds and it will be very dark. A huge swarm of locusts has covered the mountains like a black cloud. Nothing like this has ever happened before, and nothing like this will ever happen again."},{"number":3,"verse":"It is as though they bring flames of fire from which no one can escape. In front of them, the land was as beautiful as the garden of Eden, but behind them the land is like a desert, and nothing survives."},{"number":4,"verse":"The locusts resemble horses, and they run like soldiers on horses."},{"number":5,"verse":"Leaping over the mountaintops, they make a noise like rumbling chariots, like a mighty army that is preparing for a battle, or like the roar of a fire that burns up stubble in a field."},{"number":6,"verse":"When people see them coming, they become very pale and frightened."},{"number":7,"verse":"The locusts climb over walls like soldiers do; they march along in columns and never turn aside from their lines."},{"number":8,"verse":"They rush straight ahead without pushing each other.

Gather the people together! Set apart time to fast, to show that you are sorry for your sins."},{"number":16,"verse":"Perform the rituals to cause yourselves to be acceptable to Yahweh.

He will send abundant rain at the right time— in the spring and in the autumn, as he did previously."},{"number":24,"verse":"The ground where you thresh the grain will be covered with grain, and your vats where you store the fresh grape juice and olive oil will overflow."},{"number":25,"verse":"Yahweh said, \"I will repay you for everything that was destroyed by those great swarms of locusts, that enormous army that I sent to attack you."},{"number":26,"verse":"You, my people, will eat until your stomachs are full.
