The two of them will live together as though they were one person.'"},{"number":6,"verse":"Consequently, although they functioned as two separate people before, they now become as if they were one person. Since that is true, a man must not separate from his wife whom God has joined to him.\""},{"number":7,"verse":"The Pharisees then said to him, \"If that is true, why did Moses command that a man who wanted to divorce his wife should give her a paper stating his reason for divorcing her, and then send her away?\""},{"number":8,"verse":"Jesus said to them, \"It was because your ancestors stubbornly wanted their own ways that Moses allowed them to divorce their wives, and you are no different from them.

There are other men who do not marry because they have been castrated. Then there are still other men who decide not to marry in order to serve God better as he rules from heaven. You who are able to understand what I have said about marriage should accept it and obey it.\""},{"number":13,"verse":"Then some little children were brought to Jesus in order that he might lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples scolded the people for doing that."},{"number":14,"verse":"But Jesus said, \"Let the children come to me, and do not stop them! It is people who are humble and trusting like they are who belong to the rule of God from heaven.\""},{"number":15,"verse":"Jesus then laid his hands on the children to bless them. Then he left that place."},{"number":16,"verse":"As Jesus was walking along, a young man approached him and said to him, \"Teacher, what good deeds must I do in order to live with God forever?\""},{"number":17,"verse":"Jesus said to him, \"Why are you asking me about what is good? Only one being is good and really knows what is good. That being is God.

It is even more difficult for rich people to come under the rule of God.\""},{"number":25,"verse":"When the disciples heard this, they were very astounded. They thought that rich people were the ones whom God blesses the most. So they said to Jesus, \"If that is so, it does not seem likely that anyone will be saved!\""},{"number":26,"verse":"Then Jesus looked intently at them and said, \"Yes, it is impossible for people to save themselves. But God can save them, because God is able to do anything!\""},{"number":27,"verse":"Then Peter said to him, \"You know that we have left everything behind and we have become your disciples in order to follow you.
