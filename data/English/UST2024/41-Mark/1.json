People called him\" The Baptizer.\" John was in the wilderness; he was baptizing people and telling them, \"Be sorry that you have sinned, and decide to stop it, so that God may forgive you. Then I will baptize you.\""},{"number":5,"verse":"A great number of people from the district of Judea and the city of Jerusalem went out to the wilderness to hear John speak. Many of those who heard him agreed that they had sinned. Then John baptized them in the Jordan River."},{"number":6,"verse":"John wore rough clothes made of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate grasshoppers and honey that he found in that wilderness area."},{"number":7,"verse":"He was preaching, \"Very shortly one will come who is very great. I am nothing compared to him. I am not even worthy to stoop down and untie his sandals."},{"number":8,"verse":"I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\""},{"number":9,"verse":"During the time when John was preaching, Jesus came from Nazareth, a town in the district of Galilee.

On the next Sabbath, he went into the synagogue and began teaching the people who had gathered there."},{"number":22,"verse":"They were amazed at the way he taught.

The man with the evil spirit began shouting,"},{"number":24,"verse":"\"Hey! Jesus, from Nazareth! We evil spirits have nothing to do with you! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are.

He also forced many evil spirits to come out from people. He did not allow the demons to tell people about him, because they knew that he was the Holy One from God."},{"number":35,"verse":"Jesus got up very early the next morning while it was still dark. He left the house and went away from the town to a place where there were no people.

He was no longer a leper!"},{"number":43,"verse":"Jesus gave the man a warning as he was sending him away."},{"number":44,"verse":"He said, \"Do not tell anyone what just happened. Instead, go to a priest and show yourself to him in order that he may examine you and see that you no longer have leprosy. Then make the offering that Moses commanded for people whom God has healed from leprosy. This will be the testimony to the community that you do not have leprosy.\""},{"number":45,"verse":"The man did not follow Jesus' instruction. He began telling many people about how Jesus had healed him. As a result, Jesus was no longer able to enter towns publicly because the crowds of people would surround him. Instead, he remained outside the towns in places where no one lived. But people kept coming to him from all over that region."}]}
