In the past you committed all kinds of sexually immoral acts, you got drunk and then participated in orgies and carousing, and you worshiped idols, which is disgusting to God."},{"number":4,"verse":"Now your friends are surprised that you do not join with them anymore when they do these things. As a result, they say bad things about you."},{"number":5,"verse":"But one day they will have to admit to God everything they have done. He is the one who will judge them."},{"number":6,"verse":"That is the reason why the Messiah preached the good news to the dead.

May we all praise God because he has all authority to rule everything forever. May it be so!"},{"number":12,"verse":"You whom I love, do not be surprised about the painful things that you are suffering because you belong to the Messiah. Those things are testing you as people test metal by putting it into a fire. Do not think that something strange is happening to you."},{"number":13,"verse":"Instead, rejoice that you are suffering the same kinds of things that the Messiah endured. Rejoice when you suffer, in order that you may also be very glad when the Messiah returns and shows everyone how glorious he is."},{"number":14,"verse":"If others insult you because you believe in the Messiah, God is pleased with you, because it shows that the Spirit of God, the Spirit who reveals how great God is, lives within you."},{"number":15,"verse":"If you suffer, do not let it be because you murdered anyone, or stole anything, or did some other kind of evil thing, or because you interfered in someone else's affairs."},{"number":16,"verse":"But if you suffer because you are a Christian, do not be ashamed about it. Instead, praise God that you are suffering because you belong to the Messiah."},{"number":17,"verse":"I say this, because it is now time for God to begin judging people, and first he will judge those who belong to him. Since he will judge us believers first, think about the terrible things that will happen to those who do not obey the good news that comes from him!"},{"number":18,"verse":"That will be as it is written in the scriptures: \" Many righteous people will have to suffer many difficult trials before going to heaven. So ungodly and sinful people will surely have to suffer much severe punishment from God!\""},{"number":19,"verse":"Therefore, those who suffer because God wishes it, should trust God to keep themâ€” God is the one who created them and he is the one who always does what he promises to do. And so they should continue to do what is right."}]}
