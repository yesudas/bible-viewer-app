I lived just like the other Pharisees."},{"number":6,"verse":"Today I am on trial because I am confidently expecting that God will do what he promised to our ancestors."},{"number":7,"verse":"Our twelve Jewish tribes are also confidently waiting for God to do for us what he promised, as they honor him and worship him, day and night. Honored king, I confidently expect that God will do what he promised, and they also believe that! But it is for what I expect God to do that they say I have done wrong."},{"number":8,"verse":"Why would any of you think that God could not raise the dead?"},{"number":9,"verse":"There was a time in the past when I, too, was sure that I should do everything that I could to stop people from believing in Jesus from Nazareth town."},{"number":10,"verse":"So that is what I did when I lived in Jerusalem. I shut up many of the believers in prison, as the chief priests there had given me power to do. And when their people killed believers, I voted in favor of that."},{"number":11,"verse":"I punished those Jewish people in every synagogue where I could find them. I would force them, with all my anger against them, to make them insult God and curse his name.

But while I was on my way,"},{"number":13,"verse":"at about noon, I saw on the road a bright light in the sky. It was even brighter than the sun! It shone all around me, and also around those who were traveling with me."},{"number":14,"verse":"We all fell to the ground. Then I heard the voice of someone speaking to me in the Hebrew language.
