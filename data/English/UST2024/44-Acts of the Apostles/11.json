When Peter returned from Caesarea to Jerusalem, they met with him and criticized him."},{"number":3,"verse":"They said to him, \"Not only was it wrong for you to visit in the homes of uncircumcized non-Jews, you even ate with them!\""},{"number":4,"verse":"So Peter began to explain exactly what had happened."},{"number":5,"verse":"He said, \"I was praying by myself in the city of Joppa, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw that something like a large sheet was being lowered from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was."},{"number":6,"verse":"As I was looking intently into it, I saw some tame animals and also some wild animals, reptiles, and wild birds."},{"number":7,"verse":"Then I heard God commanding me, 'Peter, get up, kill and eat them!'"},{"number":8,"verse":"But I replied, 'Lord, you surely do not really want me to do that, because I have never eaten anything that our laws say that we must not eat!'"},{"number":9,"verse":"God spoke from heaven to me a second time, 'I am God, so if I have made something acceptable to eat, do not say it is unacceptable.'"},{"number":10,"verse":"This same thing happened two more times, and then the sheet with all those animals and birds was pulled up into heaven again."},{"number":11,"verse":"At that exact moment, three men who had been sent from Caesarea arrived at the house where I was staying."},{"number":12,"verse":"God's Spirit told me that I should not hesitate to go with them even though they were not Jews.

So I could not possibly tell God that he did wrong when he gave them the Holy Spirit!\""},{"number":18,"verse":"After those Jewish believers heard what Peter said, they stopped criticizing him.
