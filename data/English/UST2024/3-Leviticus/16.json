If Aaron goes in that room when it is not the proper time, he will die!"},{"number":3,"verse":"When Aaron enters the very holy place in the sacred tent, he must bring a bull that will be killed to become an offering for sins, and a ram to be killed to be an offering that the priests will burn whole on the altar."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then Aaron must bathe his whole body and put on the linen underwear and the linen tunic. He must tie the linen sash around his waist and wrap the turban around his head. These are his sacred garments."},{"number":5,"verse":"The Israelite people must then bring to him two male goats to be killed as an offering for sin, and a ram to be killed and burned whole on the altar."},{"number":6,"verse":"Aaron must offer the bull to me to be a sacrifice in order that I will forgive his sins and his family's sins."},{"number":7,"verse":"Then he must bring the two male goats to me at the entrance to the sacred tent."},{"number":8,"verse":"He must cast lots to determine which goat will be sacrificed to me and which will be the goat that he will set free."},{"number":9,"verse":"Aaron must bring to me the goat that was chosen to be sacrificed.

Then Yahweh will forgive their sins."},{"number":25,"verse":"He must also burn on the altar all the fat of the two animals that were sacrificed."},{"number":26,"verse":"After the man who was to lead the goat into the wilderness has done that and set it free, then he must return, wash his clothes, and bathe himself. Then he may enter the camp again."},{"number":27,"verse":"The carcasses of the bull and the goat that were slaughtered as an offering for the people's sins, to make atonement for them, must be carried outside the camp and burned.
