There he will teach us how he wants us to conduct our lives, and we will do what he wants us to do.\" Mount Zion is the place where he will teach people; and people will go out from Jerusalem to tell others his messages."},{"number":3,"verse":"Yahweh will settle disputes between many different people and groups who are fighting against each other, and he will also settle disputes between powerful nations that are far away. Then people will hammer their swords to cause them to become plow blades, and hammer their spears to cause them to become pruning knives. Armies of nations will no longer fight against armies of other nations, and they will no longer train men how to fight in wars."},{"number":4,"verse":"Everyone will sit peacefully under his own grapevines, and under his own fig trees; no one will cause them to be afraid.

I will cause you to be very strong, as if you had horns made of iron, as if you had hooves made of bronze; and you will crush many nations. Then you will take from your enemies the valuable things that they have taken from other countries, and I will cause you to dedicate those things to me, the one who is the Lord of all the people on the earth.\""}]}
