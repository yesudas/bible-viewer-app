No one will gather up their bones and bury them again; they will remain scattered on the ground like dung."},{"number":3,"verse":"And all the people of this wicked nation who are still alive and whom I have exiled to other countries will say, 'We would prefer to die than to continue to stay alive here in these countries.' That will be true because I, Yahweh, have said it.\""},{"number":4,"verse":"Yahweh said to me, \"Jeremiah, tell the people that this is what I, Yahweh, am saying to them: 'When people fall down, they get up again, do they not? When people are going along a road and find out that they are walking on the wrong road, they go back and find the correct road, do they not?"},{"number":5,"verse":"Yes, they do, so why do these people of Judah continue trusting in those idols that have deceived them? They continue turning away from me and betray my covenant, even though I have warned them of what will happen."},{"number":6,"verse":"I have listened carefully to what they say, but they do not say what they should say.

No one says, \"I have done wicked things.\" They are sinning and doing what they want to; Charging into sinful behavior with the excitement of a horse that is running into a battle."},{"number":7,"verse":"Even the stork knows when the seasons change, and the dove, the swallow, and the crane understanding the time of their migration! But my people do not know what I, Yahweh, require them to do."},{"number":8,"verse":"Your men who teach you the laws that Moses wrote have been saying false things about those laws.

Truly, they were not very wise to do that!"},{"number":10,"verse":"So, I will give their wives to other men; I will give their fields to the enemy soldiers who conquer them.

They tell the people that everything will go well with them, but that is not true; things will not go well with them."},{"number":12,"verse":"They should be ashamed when they do disgusting things, but they do not even know how to show on their faces that they are ashamed about their sins. So, they also will be among those who will be killed. They will be destroyed when I punish them."},{"number":13,"verse":"I will allow their enemies to take away the figs and grapes that the people would have harvested from their fields. Their fruit trees will all wither. They will not receive all the blessings that I prepared for them. This will certainly happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.'\""},{"number":14,"verse":"Then the people will say, \"Why should we wait here in these small towns? We should go to the cities that have high walls around them, but even if we do that we will be killed there, Because Yahweh our God has decided that we must be destroyed; it is as though he has given us a cup of poison to drink, because we sinned against him."},{"number":15,"verse":"We hoped that things would go well for us, but things have not gone well.
