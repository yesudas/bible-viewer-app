I continued to prophesy there about what would happen. I continued to say, \"Yahweh says that he is about to allow the army of the king of Babylon to capture this city."},{"number":4,"verse":"And the soldiers of Babylonia will most definitely capture King Zedekiah and take him to the king of Babylon for a face to face encounter."},{"number":5,"verse":"Then his soldiers will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will remain there until I arrange for him to be punished. And if he tries to fight against the soldiers from Babylonia, he will not succeed.\" King Zedekiah asked Jeremiah why he continued to say that, but Yahweh had said this would be so."},{"number":6,"verse":"At that time, Yahweh gave Jeremiah another message. He said,"},{"number":7,"verse":"\"Your cousin Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle, will come to you. He will say to you, 'Buy my field at Anathoth, your hometown.

You people of Jerusalem have been saying, 'The army of the king of Babylon will conquer it, either by their swords or because of famines or diseases.'

People will sign documents about buying those fields, and other people will witness them doing that. That will happen in the land where the descendants of Benjamin live and here in the villages near Jerusalem, in other towns in Judah, in the hill country and in the foothills to the west, and in the southern Judean wilderness. Some day I will cause them to prosper again. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.'\""}]}
