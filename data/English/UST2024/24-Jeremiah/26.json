Tell them everything that I tell you; do not leave out anything."},{"number":3,"verse":"If you do tell them everything, perhaps they will pay attention, and each one of them will turn away from his evil behavior. Then I will change my mind, and not bring on them the disaster that I was planning to bring on them because of the evil things that they have done."},{"number":4,"verse":"Say to them, 'This is what Yahweh says: I sent to you the prophets who serve me, to tell you what you should do. I sent them to you many times, but you have not paid attention to what they said. If you will not pay attention to what I say and do not obey the message that I have given to you, and if you do not pay attention to what the prophets say,"},{"number":6,"verse":"I will destroy this temple like I destroyed Shiloh, the place where the sacred tent was put. And I will cause Jerusalem to be a place whose name people in every nation on the earth will say when they curse someone.'\""},{"number":7,"verse":"Jeremiah did what Yahweh told him to do. The priests, the false prophets, and many other people listened to him as he told them that message outside the temple."},{"number":8,"verse":"But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling them everything that Yahweh had commanded him to say, they all seized him and said, \"You must be executed!"},{"number":9,"verse":"Why are you prophesying that this temple will be destroyed like Shiloh was destroyed?

So you can do to me whatever you want to do."},{"number":15,"verse":"But you need to know that if you kill me, you will be killing a man who is innocent.

There will be a large clump of trees on top of the hill where the temple is now.'"},{"number":19,"verse":"But did Hezekiah or anyone else in Judah kill Micah for saying that? No! Instead, Hezekiah revered Yahweh, and pleaded that he would act mercifully toward them. So, Yahweh changed his mind about sending to them the terrible disaster that he said he would send. And now if we kill Jeremiah, we are going to bring even worse disaster on ourselves!\""},{"number":20,"verse":"At that time, Uriah son of Shemaiah from the city of Kiriath Jearim was also prophesying from Yahweh.
