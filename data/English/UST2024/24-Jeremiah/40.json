This is how it happened:"},{"number":2,"verse":"Nebuzaradan, the captain of the king's guards, found that Jeremiah was there. He summoned Jeremiah and said to him, \"Yahweh your God said that he would cause this land to experience a disaster."},{"number":3,"verse":"And now he has caused it to happen. He has done just what he said that he would do, because you people sinned against Yahweh and refused to obey him."},{"number":4,"verse":"But today I am going to take the chains off your wrists and release you. If you want to come with me to Babylon, that will be fine. I will take care of you. But if you do not want to come with me, do not come. Stay here. Look, the entire country is available; you can choose whatever part you want to go to. You can go wherever you think it is best.\" Then he took the chains off Jeremiah's wrists."},{"number":5,"verse":"He said, \"If you decide to stay here, go to Gedaliah. The king of Babylon appointed him to be the governor of Judah. You will be allowed to stay here with the people that he is governing.

Those who went included Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai from Netophath, and Jezaniah from Maacah, and the soldiers who were with them."},{"number":9,"verse":"Gedaliah solemnly promised that the soldiers from Babylonia would not harm them. He said, \"Do not be afraid to do things for them. Stay here in this land and do things for the king of Babylon. If you do that, things will go well for you."},{"number":10,"verse":"As for me, I will stay here at Mizpah to be your representative to the officials from Babylonia who come to talk with us. But you should return to your towns, and eat the things that are produced on your land. Harvest the grapes and the fruit that ripens in the summer and the olives, make wine and olive oil, and store it.\""},{"number":11,"verse":"Then the Jews who had fled to Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other nearby countries heard people say that the king of Babylon had allowed a few people to remain in Judah, and that he had appointed Gedaliah to be their governor."},{"number":12,"verse":"So they began to return to Judah.

He said, \"Allow me to go and murder Ishmael secretly. It would not be good to allow him to come and murder you! If you are killed, what will happen to all the Jews who have returned to this area? They will be scattered, and the other people who remain in Judah will all be killed!\""},{"number":16,"verse":"But Gedaliah said to Johanan, \"No, I will not allow you to do that. I think that you are lying about Ishmael.\""}]}
