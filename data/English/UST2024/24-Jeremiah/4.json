Just as farmers do not waste good seed by sowing seeds among thorny plants, I do not want to waste my time telling you messages that you are not ready to receive."},{"number":4,"verse":"Show that your inner beings and your minds are devoted to me. If you do not do that, my being angry with you because of all the sins that you have committed will be like a fire that will be impossible to extinguish."},{"number":5,"verse":"Declare this to all the people in Jerusalem and the rest of Judea; blow the trumpets everywhere in the land to warn the people.

They will not be like a gentle breeze that separates the wheat from the chaff. They will be like a very hot wind that blows in from the desert."},{"number":12,"verse":"They will be like a strong blast that I will send. Now I am declaring that I will punish you.\""},{"number":13,"verse":"And the people in Jerusalem will say, \"Our enemies are about to rush down on us; their chariots are like whirlwinds.

Suddenly all our tents will be destroyed; even the curtains inside the tents will be ripped apart."},{"number":21,"verse":"How long will this battle continue? How long will I continue to see the enemy battle flags and hear the sound of their trumpets being blown?"},{"number":22,"verse":"Yahweh says: My people are very foolish! They do not have a relationship with me. They are like stupid children who do not understand anything. They very cleverly do what is wrong, but they do not know how to do what is good."},{"number":23,"verse":"God gave me a vision in which I saw that the earth was barren and without form. I looked at the sky, and there was no light there."},{"number":24,"verse":"I looked at the mountains and hills, and they shook and moved from side to side."},{"number":25,"verse":"I looked and saw that all there were no more people and all the birds had flown away."},{"number":26,"verse":"I looked and saw that the fields that previously were fertile had become a desert.
