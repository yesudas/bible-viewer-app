Many people of Nineveh will be killed; there will be piles of corpses, so many that the attackers will stumble over them."},{"number":4,"verse":"All that will happen because Nineveh is like a beautiful prostitute who lures men to where they will be ruined; Nineveh is a beautiful city that has attracted people of other nations to come there. The people of Nineveh taught those people of other nations rituals of magic, and caused them to become their slaves."},{"number":5,"verse":"So Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says to the people of Nineveh: \"I am your enemy, and I will cause the people in other nations to see you completely humiliated; like women who have committed adultery are humiliated by having their skirts lifted high, with the result that people can see their naked bodies."},{"number":6,"verse":"I will cause others to throw garbage at you; I will show others that I despise you very much, and I will cause everyone to ridicule you in public."},{"number":7,"verse":"All those who see you will turn their backs to you and say, 'Nineveh is ruined, but absolutely no one will mourn for it.'

The governments of the nearby countries of Put and Libya were also allies of Thebes."},{"number":10,"verse":"Nevertheless, Thebes was captured, and its people were exiled. Their babies were dashed to pieces in the streets of the city. Enemy soldiers cast lots to decide who would get each official in Thebes to become his slave.

The gates of your city will be opened wide to allow your enemies to enter them, and then the bars of those gates will be burned."},{"number":14,"verse":"Store up water now to use when your enemies surround the city! Repair the forts! Dig up clay and trample it to make it soft, and put it into molds to make bricks to repair the walls!"},{"number":15,"verse":"Nevertheless, your enemies will burn your city; they will kill you with their swords; they will kill you as locusts destroy crops. Go ahead and increase your population like swarms of locusts and grasshoppers."},{"number":16,"verse":"In your city there are now very many merchants; more than stars. But when your city is being destroyed, those merchants will take the valuable things and disappear like locusts that strip the leaves from plants and then fly away."},{"number":17,"verse":"Your leaders are also like a swarm of locusts that crowd together on the fences on a cold day, and then fly away when the sun comes up, and no one knows where they have gone."},{"number":18,"verse":"King of Assyria, your officials will all die; your important people will lie down and rest forever.

And all those who hear about what has happened to you will clap their hands joyfully. They will say, \"Everyone has suffered because he continually acted very cruelly toward us.\""}]}
