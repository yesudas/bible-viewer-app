It had ten horns and seven heads. On each of its horns there was a royal crown. On each of its heads there was a name that insulted God."},{"number":2,"verse":"This beast was like a leopard. But its feet were like the feet of a bear, and its mouth was like the mouth of a lion. The dragon made the beast very powerful. He gave him the authority to rule over people as king."},{"number":3,"verse":"One of the heads of the beast looked as if someone had wounded it so that it died. But its wound had healed. As a result, all the people of the earth marveled at the beast and followed it."},{"number":4,"verse":"They also worshiped the dragon because he had given the beast authority to rule over them. They also worshiped the beast and said, \"No one is as powerful as the beast! Who could ever fight against it?\""},{"number":5,"verse":"God allowed the beast to speak proudly and to insult him. God also allowed it to rule the people for forty-two months."},{"number":6,"verse":"When it spoke, it insulted God, his name, the place where he lives, and all who live in heaven."},{"number":7,"verse":"God also allowed the beast to fight against his people and conquer them.

Anyone who thinks wisely should understand that the number represents mankind. It is 666."}]}
