As for our guilt for committing those sins, it is as though it rises up to the heavens."},{"number":7,"verse":"Since the time that our ancestors lived until now, we have been very guilty. That is the reason that we and our kings and our priests have been defeated by the armies of the kings ofother lands. They killed some of our people, they captured some, they robbed some, and they caused them all to be disgraced, just as we are today."},{"number":8,"verse":"But now, Yahweh God, you have acted very kindly toward us.
