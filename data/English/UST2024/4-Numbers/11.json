Then the fire stopped burning."},{"number":3,"verse":"So they called that place Taberah, which means 'Burning,' because the fire from Yahweh had burned among them."},{"number":4,"verse":"Then some troublemakers from other people groups who were traveling with the Israelites began to want better food. And when they started complaining the Israelite people also started to complain. They said, \"We wish we had some meat to eat!"},{"number":5,"verse":"We remember the fish that we ate while we were in Egypt, fish that was given to us without cost. And we had all the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic we could eat."},{"number":6,"verse":"But now we have lost our appetite, because all we have to eat is this manna!\""},{"number":7,"verse":"The manna resembled small white seeds."},{"number":8,"verse":"Each morning the people would go out and gather some from the surface of the ground.

Act mercifully to me! What wrong have I done, with the result that you have appointed me to take care of all of these people?"},{"number":12,"verse":"I am not their father.

Tell them to stand with you in front of the sacred tent."},{"number":17,"verse":"I will come down and talk with you there. Then I will take some of the power of my Spirit that you have, and I will put that power on them also. They will help you to take care of some of the things that the people are concerned about, in order that you will not need to do it alone."},{"number":18,"verse":"Furthermore, say to the people, 'Make yourselves acceptable to me, and tomorrow you will have meat to eat. You were complaining, and Yahweh heard you when you were saying, \"We want some meat to eat. We had better food in Egypt!\" Now Yahweh will give you some meat, and you will eat it."},{"number":19,"verse":"You will eat meat not only for one or two days, or only for five or ten or twenty days."},{"number":20,"verse":"You will eat meat every day for one month, and then you will loathe it, and it will cause you to want to vomit.

You will now see if I can do what I say I will do.\""},{"number":24,"verse":"So Moses went out from the sacred tent and told the people what Yahweh had said. Then he gathered together the seventy leaders and told them to stand around the sacred tent."},{"number":25,"verse":"Then Yahweh came down in the cloud that was above the tent and spoke to Moses. He took some of the power of the Spirit that he had given to Moses and gave it to the seventy leaders. By means of the power of the Spirit within them, they prophesied, but they did that only once."},{"number":26,"verse":"Two of the leaders whom Moses appointed, Eldad and Medad, were not there when the rest of them gathered together. They had not left their tents to go and stand around the sacred tent.

But while they were still eating the meat, Yahweh showed that he was very angry with them. He sent a severe plague on them, and many people died."},{"number":34,"verse":"The people who died and were buried were the ones who had said they wanted to eat meat like they had formerly eaten in Egypt. So they called that place Kibroth Hattaavah, which means 'graves of those who craved.'"},{"number":35,"verse":"From there, the Israelites continued walking east until they arrived at Hazeroth, where they stopped and stayed for a long time."}]}
