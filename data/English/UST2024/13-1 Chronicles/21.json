Then come back and report to me, in order that I may know how many men there are.\""},{"number":3,"verse":"But Joab replied, \"Your Majesty, I hope that Yahweh will make our army a hundred times larger than it is now. But we all serve you. So you should not commit this sin and make Israel suffer for it.\""},{"number":4,"verse":"But David would not change his mind. So Joab and his soldiers went everywhere in Israel and in Judah, and counted the people. Then they returned to Jerusalem,"},{"number":5,"verse":"and they reported to David that there were 1100000 men in Israel who could be in the army, and 470000 in Judah."},{"number":6,"verse":"However, Joab did not count the men from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, because he was disgusted with what the king had commanded."},{"number":7,"verse":"David's command to count the people caused God to become angry, so he told David that he had decided to punish the people of Israel."},{"number":8,"verse":"Then David prayed to God.

But when the angel was standing at the ground where Ornan, from the Jebus people group, threshed grain, Yahweh saw all the suffering that the people had endured, and he was grieved.

I will pay the full price.\""},{"number":23,"verse":"Ornan replied, \"Take it! Your Majesty, do whatever you want to. I will give you the oxen that thresh the grain for an offering to be completely burned on the altar.

I will give all those things to you.\""},{"number":24,"verse":"But the king said to Ornan, \"No, I will not take these things as a gift. I will pay you the full price for it. I will not take what belongs to you, and offer sacrifices that have cost me nothing and offer them to Yahweh to be completely burned on the altar.\""},{"number":25,"verse":"So David paid to Ornan six and one-half kilograms of gold for the whole area."},{"number":26,"verse":"David built an altar to worship Yahweh there, and he offered sacrifices to be completely burned on the altar and sacrifices to restore fellowship with Yahweh.
