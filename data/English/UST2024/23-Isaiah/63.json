It appears that you have been treading on grapes to make wine.\""},{"number":3,"verse":"He replies, \"I have been treading on my enemies, not on grapes. I did it myself; no one helped me. I punished them because I was very angry with them, and my clothes became stained with their blood."},{"number":4,"verse":"I did that because it was time for me to get revenge; it was time to rescue my people from those who had oppressed them."},{"number":5,"verse":"I searched for someone who would enable me to help my people, but I was amazed that there was no one to help me.

So he became like an enemy who fought against us."},{"number":11,"verse":"Then we thought about what happened long ago, during the time when Moses led our ancestors out of Egypt.
