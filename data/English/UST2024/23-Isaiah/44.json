Those who make idols are only human beings, but they claim that they are making gods!

They pound them with hammers and shape them.

He uses a chisel and other tools to carve it to resemble a human. He causes it to become a very beautiful idol, and then he puts it in a special house, where he will bow down to it."},{"number":14,"verse":"Before he carves an idol from that block of wood, he has already cut down a cedar tree, or he has selected a cypress tree or an oak tree and allowed it to grow tall in the forest. Or he has planted a pine tree, and the rain has watered it and caused it to grow tall."},{"number":15,"verse":"After he uses part of the tree to make an idol, he uses the other part to make a fire, either to warm himself or to bake bread. But he uses part of the same tree to make for himself an idol to worship! He makes an idol, and then he bows down to worship it."},{"number":16,"verse":"He burns part of the wood of that tree to cook his meat and eats it and becomes full, and he burns part of it to warm himself, and he says, \"I feel warm while I am watching the flames in the fire.\""},{"number":17,"verse":"Then he takes the rest of the wood and makes an idol which is to be his god. He bows down to it and honors it, and prays to it and says, \"You are my god, so save me!\""},{"number":18,"verse":"Those people are very stupid and ignorant. It is as though they were blind and unable to see, as though their minds were closed and unable to think well."},{"number":19,"verse":"They do not think about what they are doing, that they are taking a block of wood and burning half of it to warm themselves and using some of the rest to bake bread and roast some meat! They do not say to themselves, \"It is stupid to take the rest of the wood to make a detestable idol! It does not make sense to bow down to a block of wood!\""},{"number":20,"verse":"They might as well be eating the ashes from a fire! They trust in something that cannot save them; they do not admit, \"In my hand I hold something that is not really a god! \""},{"number":21,"verse":"Yahweh says, \"You descendants of Jacob, you people of Israel who should be serving me, I created you, and I will not forget you."},{"number":22,"verse":"I have gotten rid of your sins like the wind blows away a cloud.

I am the only one who stretched out the sky. There was no one who was with me when I created the earth."},{"number":25,"verse":"I show that the false prophets are liars, and I show that those who perform rituals to predict the future are fools. Some people who falsely think that they are wise say that they know much, but I show that they are foolish."},{"number":26,"verse":"But I always cause to happen what my prophets predict. I tell them to say to the people of Jerusalem, 'Some day people will live here again.'
