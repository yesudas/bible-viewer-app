You have all of your teeth on both sides; none of them is missing."},{"number":3,"verse":"Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon, and your mouth is lovely. Beneath your veil, your cheeks are round and rosy like the halves of a pomegranate."},{"number":4,"verse":"Your long neck is beautiful, like the tower of King David that was built using layers of stone.
