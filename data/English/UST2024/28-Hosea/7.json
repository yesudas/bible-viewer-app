They lie and cheat in their buying and selling; they are like lawless men who attack people who are walking in the streets."},{"number":2,"verse":"But they do not take a moment to think that I, Yahweh, see everything they do. Everywhere they go, they commit evil, and I see it all."},{"number":3,"verse":"The wicked things they do bring delight to their king, and the king's officials are happy when they tell lies."},{"number":4,"verse":"They are all sexually immoral; they burn with lust like a baker's oven that is burning hot; once he lights the fire, he does not need to put any more wood on it, until he is ready to bake the bread."},{"number":5,"verse":"At the king's festivals, his officials do outrageous things because they are drunk with wine, and the king joins in with them as they mock me."},{"number":6,"verse":"But these same officials then set about making plans to murder the king. They are quietly angry all night, and they are openly angry in the morning."},{"number":7,"verse":"All those officials become so angry at the king, that they kill all their rulers.

I wanted to rescue them, but they kept telling lies against me."},{"number":14,"verse":"They do not cry out to me; they do not call to me from their hearts; they only lie on their beds and howl and cry out. They meet together to ask their idols for their grain and new wine. They have rebelled against me."},{"number":15,"verse":"Even though I trained them and helped them become strong, even now they are planning to do evil against me."},{"number":16,"verse":"They go this way and that, but never to me, God Most High. They are like a bow that cannot shoot. Their officers will be killed by their enemies' swords;they will die because they have insulted me. This is why the people in Egypt will insult them.\""}]}
