But later, he said to himself, 'I do not revere God and I do not care about people,"},{"number":5,"verse":"but this widow keeps bothering me! So I will judge her case and make sure she is treated fairly, because if I do not do that, she will exhaust me by continually coming to me!'\""},{"number":6,"verse":"Then the Lord Jesus said, \"Think carefully about what the unjust judge said."},{"number":7,"verse":"Even more certainly will God, who is just, bring about justice for his chosen people, who pray earnestly to him night and day!

One of the men was a Pharisee. The other was someone who collected taxes from the people for the Roman government."},{"number":11,"verse":"The Pharisee stood and prayed about himself in this way, 'O God, I thank you that I am not like other people. Some steal money from others, some treat others unjustly, and some commit adultery. I do not do any of those things. And I am certainly not like this sinful tax collector who cheats people!"},{"number":12,"verse":"I fast two days every week and I give to the temple ten percent of all that I earn!'"},{"number":13,"verse":"But the tax collector stood far away from the other people in the temple courtyard.

We are now going up to Jerusalem. While we are there, everything that the prophets wrote long ago about me, the Son of Man, will be accomplished."},{"number":32,"verse":"My enemies will put me into the power of the non-Jews.
