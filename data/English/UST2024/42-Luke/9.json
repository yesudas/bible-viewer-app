God prevented them from understanding it, so that they would not know yet what he meant, and they were afraid to ask him about what he had said."},{"number":46,"verse":"Some time later, the disciples began to argue among themselves about which one of them would be the most important."},{"number":47,"verse":"But Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he brought a young child to stand beside him."},{"number":48,"verse":"He said to them, \"If someone welcomes a little child like this because of me, it is the same as welcoming me.
