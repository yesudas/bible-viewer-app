He said to Ishbosheth, \"Do you think that I am a worthless dog from Judah? From the beginning I have been loyal to Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends. And I have kept David's army from defeating you. So now why are you criticizing me about what I have done with some woman?"},{"number":9,"verse":"Yahweh solemnly promised that he would not allow Saul and his descendants to continue to rule. He promised that he would cause David to rule over all the tribes of Israel and Judah, from the city of Dan far in the north to the city of Beersheba far in the south.

Listen to me!

They found him at the well of Sirah and brought him back to Hebron, but David did not know that they had done this."},{"number":27,"verse":"So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab met him at the city gate, and took him into a side room as though he wanted to speak with him privately.
