They went in order to bring the sacred chest to Jerusalem, the chest that had the name of Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, written on it, and that had the figures of the winged creatures on top of it. Between those statues was where Yahweh himself was present, though he remained unseen."},{"number":3,"verse":"The sacred chest was in the house of Abinadab, on top of a hill. They went there, and put the chest on a new cart.

And I will continue to dance to honor Yahweh!"},{"number":22,"verse":"Even though you think that what I did was disgraceful, I will continue to act in this way because I am willing to be made a fool in my own eyes. But the female servants whom you were talking about, they will give me honor!\""},{"number":23,"verse":"As a result, Saul's daughter never gave birth to any children."}]}
