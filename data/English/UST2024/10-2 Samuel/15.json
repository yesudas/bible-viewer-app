Whenever someone came there with a dispute with someone that he wanted the king to decide, Absalom would call out to him, asking, \"What city are you from?\" The person would tell him what city and tribe he was from."},{"number":3,"verse":"Then Absalom would say to him, \"Listen, I am sure that what you are saying is right. But there is no one whom the king has appointed to listen to people like you.\""},{"number":4,"verse":"Absalom would then add, \"I wish that I were a judge in this land. If I were a judge, anyone who had a dispute could come to me, and I would decide it fairly.\""},{"number":5,"verse":"And whenever anyone came near to Absalom to bow respectfully in front of him, Absalom would reach out and embrace him and kiss him."},{"number":6,"verse":"Absalom did this to everyone in Israel who came to the king with a dispute to be decided. In that way, Absalom persuaded all the Israelite people to be more pleased with him than they were pleased with his father David."},{"number":7,"verse":"Four years later, Absalom went to the king and said, \"Please allow me to go to the city of Hebron, in order that I can do what I promised Yahweh that I would do."},{"number":8,"verse":"When I was living in Geshur, in Aram, I promised Yahweh that if he brought me back to Jerusalem, I would worship him in Hebron.\""},{"number":9,"verse":"The king replied, \"I will permit you to go safely.\" So Absalom went to Hebron."},{"number":10,"verse":"But while he was there, he secretly sent messengers to all the tribes in Israel to tell them, \"When you hear the sound of the trumpets being blown, shout, 'Absalom has become the king at Hebron!'\""},{"number":11,"verse":"Absalom had taken with him to Hebron two hundred men from Jerusalem, but they did not know what Absalom was planning to do."},{"number":12,"verse":"While Absalom was offering sacrifices at Hebron, he sent a message to Ahithophel from the town of Giloh, requesting him to come.

Go back and stay with Absalom the new king. You are not an Israelite; you are living away from your own land."},{"number":20,"verse":"You have lived here in Israel for only a short time. And we do not even know where we will be going. So it is not right for me to force you to wander around with us. And take your troops with you.

If Yahweh is pleased with me, he will some day allow me to return to see it and the place where it is kept."},{"number":26,"verse":"But if he says that he is not pleased with me, then I am willing for him to do to me whatever he thinks is good.\""},{"number":27,"verse":"He also said to Zadok, \"Listen to what I suggest!
