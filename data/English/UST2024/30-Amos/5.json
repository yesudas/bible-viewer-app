{"bibleAbbr":"UST2024","bookName":"Amos","bookEnglishName":"Amos","chapterNumber":5,"verses":[{"number":1,"verse":"You people of Israel, listen to this funeral song that I will sing about you:"},{"number":2,"verse":"\"You are like a young woman, but in spite of that, you will certainly be struck down and you will never get up again! You will lie on the ground, abandoned, and there will be no one to help you stand up.\""},{"number":3,"verse":"This is what Yahweh the Lord says to the people of Israel: \"When your enemies attack you, and when a thousand of your soldiers go into battle, only a hundred will survive. When a hundred soldiers march out from a city to fight, only ten will remain alive.\""},{"number":4,"verse":"Yahweh continues to say to the people of Israel: \"You Israelite people, return to me! If you do that, you will continue to remain alive."},{"number":5,"verse":"Do not go to Bethel to seek my help; do not go to Gilgal to worship; do not go to Beersheba, because your enemies will drag away the people of Gilgal to other countries, and they will completely destroy Bethel.\""},{"number":6,"verse":"So come to Yahweh; if you do that, you will remain alive. If you do not do that, Yahweh will come down on you descendants of Joseph like a fire; that fire will burn everything in Bethel and nothing will be able to save that town."},{"number":7,"verse":"You people distort what is right; you make others think that it is something very bitter; you treat good things as though they were evil."},{"number":8,"verse":"God created all the groups of stars and he put them in their places. Each morning he causes the darkness to become the dawn, and each evening he causes the daylight to become darkness.

The one who does those things is Yahweh."},{"number":9,"verse":"He causes strong soldiers to be killed, and he causes the high walls around cities to fall down."},{"number":10,"verse":"He is the one who will punish you because you hate those who challenge anyone who tries to make unjust decisions; you hate those who tell the truth in your courts."},{"number":11,"verse":"You oppress poor people and force them to pay big taxes.

You do not allow judges to treat poor people justly."},{"number":13,"verse":"This is a time when many people do evil things, so people who have good sense say nothing at all."},{"number":14,"verse":"In order to remain alive, you must stop doing what is wrong, and start doing what is right. If you do that, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, will be with you as you claim that he always is."},{"number":15,"verse":"Love what is good, and hate what is evil! Try to cause judges in your courts to make decisions that are right! If you do those things, perhaps Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, will act mercifully toward you descendants of Joseph who are still alive."},{"number":16,"verse":"\"Because I, Yahweh, will punish you for your sins, this is what I have solemnly declared: People will be wailing loudly in every street, and people will be shocked in every plaza. Farmers will be called to come and weep, along with the other official mourners who will wail for those who have died."},{"number":17,"verse":"People will be wailing in your vineyards, because I will punish you severely.

That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, have said it!\""}]}
