The rock was the Messiah."},{"number":5,"verse":"But God was angry with most of them because they worshiped other gods and rebelled against him, so their dead bodies lay on the ground all across the wilderness."},{"number":6,"verse":"Now these things were an example for us, so we would learn not to greatly desire evil things, as they did."},{"number":7,"verse":"Some of our ancestors also worshiped idols. As the scripture says, \"The people sat down to eat and drink and then they rose up to dance wildly in a sexual way.\""},{"number":8,"verse":"Twenty-three thousand of our Jewish ancestors died in one day because of their sexual immorality."},{"number":9,"verse":"Let us not test the authority of the Messiah by disobeying him, as some of our ancestors did, and poisonous snakes killed them."},{"number":10,"verse":"Do not grumble about what God provides, as some our ancestors did, and an angel destroyed them."},{"number":11,"verse":"Now these things happened to our ancestors; they were written so we could learn from themâ€”we, who are living very close to when the world will end."},{"number":12,"verse":"And so the lesson is this: If you think you are strong and are standing strong, be very careful, because this is just when you may fall."},{"number":13,"verse":"Every temptation you have fought against is shared by us all, but God has given us his promise and he will not permit the temptation to be greater than your ability to fight against the sin.

And I do not wish that you share anything with demons."},{"number":21,"verse":"You must not drink from the Lord's cup and then later drink the cup of demons.
