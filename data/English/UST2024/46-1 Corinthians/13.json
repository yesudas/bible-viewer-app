If you truly love, you will be kind to others. If you truly love, you will not resent that other people possess things you do not have. If you truly love, you will not boast about yourself or be proud."},{"number":5,"verse":"If you truly love others, you will not abuse them. You will not live to please yourself. No one will be able to make you angry quickly. You will not keep track of the wrong things people have done."},{"number":6,"verse":"If you truly love others, you will not be happy if anyone does wicked things; instead, you will be happy when people are faithful to God."},{"number":7,"verse":"If you truly love others, you will endure everything that happens. You will trust that God will do the best things for people. You will trust in God regardless of what happens.

Those who proclaim God's messages do so only partially."},{"number":10,"verse":"But when things are complete, everything that is partial or incomplete will end."},{"number":11,"verse":"When I was a small child, I talked as a child talks, I thought as a child thinks, and I made decisions as a child makes decision. But when I became an adult, I stopped acting like a child, and I started acting like an adult."},{"number":12,"verse":"What we understand about the Messiah now, we understand very imperfectly, not well at all. But when the Messiah returns, we will see him face to face. Now we know only part of what is true. But then we will know him fully, just as he knows us fully."},{"number":13,"verse":"It is important that we trust in the Messiah now. It is important that we are certain that he will do for us everything that he has promised. And it is important that we love him and each other. But the greatest of these three things is love."}]}
