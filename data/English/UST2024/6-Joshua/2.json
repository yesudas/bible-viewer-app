Some Israelite men have come here tonight to look at our land!\""},{"number":3,"verse":"So the king sent a messenger to tell Rahab, \"Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come here to look at our land!\""},{"number":4,"verse":"Now the woman had taken the men and hidden them in her house. So she said to the king's men, \"Yes, it is true that those men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from."},{"number":5,"verse":"They left when it was dark, about the time that the guards close the city gates. I do not know where they were going.

They searched all along the road, but they did not find the two men."},{"number":23,"verse":"Then the two men started back toward their camp.
