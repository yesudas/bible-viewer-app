You have nothing to do with Yahweh.' And your children might try to stop our children from worshiping Yahweh."},{"number":26,"verse":"So we said, 'Let us now build an altar, but not for bringing sacrifices nor for any offerings."},{"number":27,"verse":"Instead, we want it to be a monument to prove to you, to ourselves, and to all of our descendants after us, that we truly worship Yahweh. We indeed worship him by our burned sacrifices and our offerings, and our offerings to promise friendship with him. We built this altar so your descendants may never say to our descendants in the future, \"Yahweh never gave you any portion of this land; you do not belong here.\"'"},{"number":28,"verse":"In the future, if your descendants say that, our descendants can say, 'Look at the altar that our ancestors made! It is exactly like Yahweh's altar at Shiloh, but we do not burn sacrifices on it. It is a monument which means that we and you together worship Yahweh!'"},{"number":29,"verse":"We certainly do not want to rebel against Yahweh or stop doing what he desires.

There they told the other Israelites what had happened."},{"number":33,"verse":"They were pleased, and they thanked God. They did not talk anymore about fighting against the people of the tribes of Reuben and Gad and destroying everything in their land."},{"number":34,"verse":"The people of the tribes of Reuben and Gad named their new altar \"Reminder, \"and they said, \"It is a reminder to us all that Yahweh is God.\""}]}
