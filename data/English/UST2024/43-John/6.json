However, Jesus already knew what he was going to do about this problem."},{"number":7,"verse":"Philip replied to him, \"If we had the money that a man can earn in two hundred days of work, it would not be enough money to buy bread to give each person in this big crowd even a little piece to eat.\""},{"number":8,"verse":"Another one of his disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter's brother, said to Jesus,"},{"number":9,"verse":"\"There is a boy here who has five little barley loaves of bread and two small fish.

Then he passed the bread and the fish among all who were sitting on the ground. The people ate all the fish and bread they wanted."},{"number":12,"verse":"When everyone had finished eating, he said to the disciples, \"Gather up all the pieces of barley bread that the people did not eat. Do not let anything go to waste.\""},{"number":13,"verse":"So they gathered up the pieces from the five barley loaves, and they filled twelve large baskets full from what was left over."},{"number":14,"verse":"After the people saw the miracle that Jesus had performed in front of them, they said, \"Surely he is the Prophet that God has been going to send into the world!\""},{"number":15,"verse":"Jesus knew what the people were planning; they were about to come and force him to be their king.

If anyone eats this bread, he will live forever. The bread that I give for the life of the world is the death of my physical body.\""},{"number":52,"verse":"The Jews who had listened to Jesus were now angrily arguing among themselves. They could not understand how anyone could promise that others would eat his own body."},{"number":53,"verse":"So Jesus confronted them with difficult words: \"I am telling you the truth: Unless you eat the flesh of me, the Son of Man, and drink my blood, you will never live forever."},{"number":54,"verse":"Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood will live forever, and I will make them alive again at the last day"},{"number":55,"verse":"because my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink."},{"number":56,"verse":"Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood will be joined to me, and I will be joined to him."},{"number":57,"verse":"My Father, who makes everyone alive, has sent me, and I live because my Father has made me able to.

Anyone who eats me—this bread—will never die, but will live forever! What I do is not like what happened to your ancestors because they ate the manna and then died.\""},{"number":59,"verse":"Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in the city of Capernaum."},{"number":60,"verse":"Many of his disciples said, \"What he is teaching is hard to understand. How can anyone accept what he is saying?\""},{"number":61,"verse":"Jesus was aware that some of his disciples were complaining, so he said to them, \"Does what I teach offend you?"},{"number":62,"verse":"What would you say if you saw me, the Son of Man, go back up to heaven?"},{"number":63,"verse":"Only the Spirit gives life that can make anyone live forever. The human nature is no help in this matter. The words I have taught you tell you about the Spirit, and they tell you about eternal life."},{"number":64,"verse":"Yet there are some of you who do not trust what I am teaching you.\" Jesus said this because he knew from the start of his work who it was who would not trust in him, and he knew the person who would betray him."},{"number":65,"verse":"Then he said, \"That is why I told you that no one can come to me and to live forever unless the Father makes him able to come to me.\""},{"number":66,"verse":"From that time on, many of Jesus' disciples turned back from following him."},{"number":67,"verse":"So he said to the twelve, \"You also do not want to leave me, do you?\""},{"number":68,"verse":"Simon Peter replied, \"Lord, to whom would we go?
