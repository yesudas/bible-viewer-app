No, for this is the very reason I came into this world."},{"number":28,"verse":"My Father, show how powerful you are in all you have said, in all you have done, and in all you are!\" Then God spoke from heaven, \"I have already displayed my nature, my words, and my works; and I will do it again!\""},{"number":29,"verse":"The crowd that was there heard the voice of God, but some said it was just thunder.
