There they will have plenty to eat, with the result that their stomachs will always be full and they will become fat. But then they will turn to other gods and start to worship them, and they will despise me and break the covenant that I have made with them."},{"number":21,"verse":"And many terrible disasters will happen to them. After that happens, their descendants will remember this song, and it will be like a witness that says, 'Now you know why Yahweh punished your ancestors.' I will soon take them into the land that I solemnly promised that I would give to them; but even now, before I do that, I know what they are thinking that they will do when they are living there.\""},{"number":22,"verse":"So on the very day that Yahweh gave Moses that song, Moses also taught it to the Israelite people."},{"number":23,"verse":"Then Yahweh appointed Joshua as leader and said to him, \"Be brave and confident, because you will lead the Israelite people into the land that I solemnly promised that I would give to them.

They have rebelled against Yahweh all during the time that I have been with them, and they will rebel much more after I die!"},{"number":28,"verse":"So gather all the elders of the tribes and your officials, in order that I can teach them the words of this song, and so that I can request all those who are in heaven and on the earth to be witnesses to testify against these people."},{"number":29,"verse":"I say this, because I know that after I die, the people will become very wicked. They will stop doing everything that I have commanded them to do. And in the future, because of all the evil things that they will do, they will cause Yahweh to become angry with them. Then he will cause them to experience disasters.\""},{"number":30,"verse":"Then, while all the Israelite people listened, Moses sang this entire song to them:"}]}
