Yet I have a covenant with Jacob and his descendants, but I have no covenant with Esau and his descendants. I caused Esau's region to be abandoned, a place where wild dogs live.\""},{"number":4,"verse":"The descendants of Esau who now live in Edom may say, \"Yes, God has demolished our cities, but we will rebuild houses in the ruins.\" But Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, replies, \"They may build houses again, but I will demolish them again.
