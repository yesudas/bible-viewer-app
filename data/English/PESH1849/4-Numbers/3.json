Who can again the womb of his mother the second time enter, and be born?"},{"number":5,"verse":"Jeshu answered and said to him, Amen, amen, I say to thee, That if a man be not born of waters and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of Aloha."},{"number":6,"verse":"Whatever is born of the flesh, is flesh; and whatever is born of the Spirit, is spirit."},{"number":7,"verse":"Wonder not that I have said to thee, that it behoves you to be born anew."},{"number":8,"verse":"The wind bloweth where she willeth,* and her voice thou hearest; but thou knowest not whence she cometh, nor whither she goeth: so is every man who is born of the Spirit. [* Rucho signifies either the Spirit, or the wind; as, in like manner, does the corresponding Greek word wneuma and hence most of the versions of the latter have, \"The Spirit bloweth where he willeth;\" but in the Syriac text the verbs and the pronominal affix to the noun \"voice\" being in the feminine, the application of Rucho to the Holy Spirit seems not to have been contemplated. OLSHAUSEN on the Greek text has well said, \"The comparison itself, and the expression, fwnhn autou, show, beyond doubt, that wneuma does not here mean the breath of the Divine Spirit, but the wind properly so called.\"]"},{"number":9,"verse":"Nikodimos answered and said to him, How can these things be?"},{"number":10,"verse":"Jeshu answered and said to him, Art thou Malphona of Israel, and these knowest not?"},{"number":11,"verse":"Amen, amen, I say to thee, What we know we speak, and what we have seen we testify; but our testimony you receive not."},{"number":12,"verse":"If of (what is) on earth I tell you, and you believe not, how if I tell you of (what is) in heaven, could you believe me?"},{"number":13,"verse":"AND no man hath ascended into heaven, but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man, he who is in heaven."},{"number":14,"verse":"And as Musha elevated the serpent in the wilderness, so is to be elevated the Son of man,"},{"number":15,"verse":"that every man who believeth in him might not perish, but have the life which is eternal."},{"number":16,"verse":"For so loved Aloha the world, as his Son, the Only-begotten, he would give, that every one who believeth in him might not perish, but have the life which is eternal."},{"number":17,"verse":"For Aloha sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might live by him."},{"number":18,"verse":"He who believeth on him is not judged, and he who believeth not is judged already, because he believeth not in the name of the only-begotten Son of Aloha."},{"number":19,"verse":"And this is the judgment, that the light hath come into the world, and the sons of men have loved darkness rather than the light, for their deeds have been evil."},{"number":20,"verse":"For every one who doeth abominable things hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved."},{"number":21,"verse":"But he who doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be known that in Aloha they are wrought."},{"number":22,"verse":"AFTER these came Jeshu and his disciples into the land of Jihuda, and there conversed with them and baptized."},{"number":23,"verse":"But Juchanon also was baptizing in Ein-yon, near Sholim, because the waters were there many; and they came and were baptized;"},{"number":24,"verse":"for not yet was Juchanon cast into the house of the bound."},{"number":25,"verse":"But there was a question with some of the disciples of Juchanon (and) a certain Jihudoya, upon purification."},{"number":26,"verse":"And they came to Juchanon, and said to him, Raban, he who was with thee at the passage of Jurdan, (and) concerning whom thou didst give witness, he also baptizeth, and many come to him."},{"number":27,"verse":"Juchanon answered and said to them, A man cannot receive of his own will any thing, unless it be given to him from heaven."},{"number":28,"verse":"You bear me witness that I said, I am not the Meshicha, but I am an apostle [Shelicho.] before him."},{"number":29,"verse":"He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and attendeth him, with great joy rejoiceth on account of the voice of the bridegroom: this my joy therefore, behold, is complete."},{"number":30,"verse":"To him it must be to increase, and to me to decrease."},{"number":31,"verse":"For he who from above hath come, is above all; and he who is from the earth, is of the earth, and of the earth speaketh: he who from heaven hath come, is above all."},{"number":32,"verse":"And what he hath seen and heard he testifieth, and his testimony no man receiveth."},{"number":33,"verse":"But he who hath received his, hath sealed that the true Aloha is he.[D'Aloha sharira-u: compare the same words, 1Jo 1:20.]"},{"number":34,"verse":"For he whom Aloha hath sent, the very words of Aloha speaketh; for it was not in measure that Aloha gave the Spirit."},{"number":35,"verse":"The Father loveth the Son, and every thing hath he given into his hands."},{"number":36,"verse":"He who believeth in the Son hath the life which is eternal; and he who obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of Aloha remaineth on him."}]}
