The consensus within biblical scholarship, although not universal, is that the Old Testament of the Peshitta was translated into Syriac from Biblical Hebrew, probably in the 2nd century CE, and that the New Testament of the Peshitta was translated from Koine Greek, probably in the early 5th century. This New Testament, originally excluding certain disputed books (2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, Revelation), had become a standard by the early 5th century. The five excluded books were added in the Harklean Version (616 CE) of Thomas of Harqel. The New Testament of the Peshitta often reflects the Byzantine text-type, although with some variations.","copyRight":"Public Domain","additionalInformation":null},"books":[{"bookNo":1,"shortName":"Gen","longName":"Genesis","englishName":"Genesis","chapterCount":28},{"bookNo":2,"shortName":"Exo","longName":"Exodus","englishName":"Exodus","chapterCount":16},{"bookNo":3,"shortName":"Lev","longName":"Leviticus","englishName":"Leviticus","chapterCount":24},{"bookNo":4,"shortName":"Num","longName":"Numbers","englishName":"Numbers","chapterCount":21},{"bookNo":5,"shortName":"Deu","longName":"Deuteronomy","englishName":"Deuteronomy","chapterCount":28},{"bookNo":6,"shortName":"Jos","longName":"Joshua","englishName":"Joshua","chapterCount":16},{"bookNo":7,"shortName":"Jdg","longName":"Judges","englishName":"Judges","chapterCount":16},{"bookNo":8,"shortName":"Rth","longName":"Ruth","englishName":"Ruth","chapterCount":13},{"bookNo":9,"shortName":"1Sa","longName":"1 Samuel","englishName":"1 Samuel","chapterCount":6},{"bookNo":10,"shortName":"2Sa","longName":"2 Samuel","englishName":"2 Samuel","chapterCount":6},{"bookNo":11,"shortName":"1Ki","longName":"1 Kings","englishName":"1 Kings","chapterCount":4},{"bookNo":12,"shortName":"2Ki","longName":"2 Kings","englishName":"2 Kings","chapterCount":4},{"bookNo":13,"shortName":"1Ch","longName":"1 Chronicles","englishName":"1 Chronicles","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":14,"shortName":"2Ch","longName":"2 Chronicles","englishName":"2 Chronicles","chapterCount":3},{"bookNo":15,"shortName":"Ezr","longName":"Ezra","englishName":"Ezra","chapterCount":6},{"bookNo":16,"shortName":"Neh","longName":"Nehemiah","englishName":"Nehemiah","chapterCount":4},{"bookNo":17,"shortName":"Est","longName":"Esther","englishName":"Esther","chapterCount":3},{"bookNo":18,"shortName":"Job","longName":"Job","englishName":"Job","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":19,"shortName":"Psa","longName":"Psalms","englishName":"Psalms","chapterCount":13},{"bookNo":20,"shortName":"Pro","longName":"Proverbs","englishName":"Proverbs","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":21,"shortName":"Ecc","longName":"Ecclesiastes","englishName":"Ecclesiastes","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":22,"shortName":"Son","longName":"Song of Songs","englishName":"Song of Songs","chapterCount":3},{"bookNo":23,"shortName":"Isa","longName":"Isaiah","englishName":"Isaiah","chapterCount":5},{"bookNo":24,"shortName":"Jer","longName":"Jeremiah","englishName":"Jeremiah","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":25,"shortName":"Lam","longName":"Lamentations","englishName":"Lamentations","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":26,"shortName":"Eze","longName":"Ezekiel","englishName":"Ezekiel","chapterCount":1},{"bookNo":27,"shortName":"Dan","longName":"Daniel","englishName":"Daniel","chapterCount":22}]}]}
