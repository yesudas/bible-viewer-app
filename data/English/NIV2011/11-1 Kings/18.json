Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.”"},{"number":6,"verse":"So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another."},{"number":7,"verse":"As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, “Is it really you, my lord Elijah?”"},{"number":8,"verse":"“Yes,” he replied. “Go tell your master, ‘Elijah is here.’”"},{"number":9,"verse":"“What have I done wrong,” asked Obadiah, “that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death?"},{"number":10,"verse":"As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you.

Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.”"},{"number":26,"verse":"So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. “Baal, answer us!” they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made."},{"number":27,"verse":"At noon Elijah began to taunt them. “Shout louder!” he said. “Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.”"},{"number":28,"verse":"So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed."},{"number":29,"verse":"Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention."},{"number":30,"verse":"Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come here to me.” They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which had been torn down."},{"number":31,"verse":"Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, “Your name shall be Israel.”"},{"number":32,"verse":"With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed."},{"number":33,"verse":"He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, “Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.”"},{"number":34,"verse":"“Do it again,” he said, and they did it again. “Do it a third time,” he ordered, and they did it the third time."},{"number":35,"verse":"The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench."},{"number":36,"verse":"At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: “LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command."},{"number":37,"verse":"Answer me, LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.”"},{"number":38,"verse":"Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench."},{"number":39,"verse":"When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, “The LORD - he is God! The LORD - he is God!”"},{"number":40,"verse":"Then Elijah commanded them, “Seize the prophets of Baal.

And he went up and looked. “There is nothing there,” he said. Seven times Elijah said, “Go back.”"},{"number":44,"verse":"The seventh time the servant reported, “A cloud as small as a man’s hand is rising from the sea.” So Elijah said, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’”"},{"number":45,"verse":"Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain started falling and Ahab rode off to Jezreel."},{"number":46,"verse":"The power of the LORD came on Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel."}]}
