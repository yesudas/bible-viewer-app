While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.”"},{"number":8,"verse":"Then Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.”"},{"number":9,"verse":"At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,"},{"number":10,"verse":"and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.”"},{"number":11,"verse":"But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’ ”"},{"number":12,"verse":"So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?”"},{"number":13,"verse":"The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there."},{"number":14,"verse":"Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “See, you are well again.

Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed."},{"number":21,"verse":"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it."},{"number":22,"verse":"Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,"},{"number":23,"verse":"that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.
