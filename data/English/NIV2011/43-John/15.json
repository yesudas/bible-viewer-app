No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me."},{"number":5,"verse":"“I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing."},{"number":6,"verse":"If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned."},{"number":7,"verse":"If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."},{"number":8,"verse":"This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples."},{"number":9,"verse":"“As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.

Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you."},{"number":16,"verse":"You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit - fruit that will last - and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you."},{"number":17,"verse":"This is my command: Love each other."},{"number":18,"verse":"(The World Hates the Disciples) “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first."},{"number":19,"verse":"If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own.
