He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him."},{"number":4,"verse":"“Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, “As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this must die!"},{"number":6,"verse":"He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity.”"},{"number":7,"verse":"Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul."},{"number":8,"verse":"I gave your master’s house to you, and your master’s wives into your arms. I gave you all Israel and Judah.

While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!”"},{"number":22,"verse":"He answered, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, ‘Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let the child live.’"},{"number":23,"verse":"But now that he is dead, why should I go on fasting? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”"},{"number":24,"verse":"Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and made love to her.
