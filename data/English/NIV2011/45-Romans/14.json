To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand."},{"number":5,"verse":"One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind."},{"number":6,"verse":"Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God."},{"number":7,"verse":"For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone."},{"number":8,"verse":"If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord.

But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean."},{"number":15,"verse":"If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died."},{"number":16,"verse":"Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil."},{"number":17,"verse":"For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,"},{"number":18,"verse":"because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval."},{"number":19,"verse":"Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification."},{"number":20,"verse":"Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food.
