I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin."},{"number":2,"verse":"God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don’t you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah - how he appealed to God against Israel:"},{"number":3,"verse":"“Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me” ?"},{"number":4,"verse":"And what was God’s answer to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace."},{"number":6,"verse":"And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace."},{"number":7,"verse":"What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain.

But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble."},{"number":21,"verse":"For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either."},{"number":22,"verse":"Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off."},{"number":23,"verse":"And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again."},{"number":24,"verse":"After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!"},{"number":25,"verse":"(All Israel Will Be Saved) I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in,"},{"number":26,"verse":"and in this way all Israel will be saved.
