First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God."},{"number":3,"verse":"What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s faithfulness?"},{"number":4,"verse":"Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written: “So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.”"},{"number":5,"verse":"But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)"},{"number":6,"verse":"Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?"},{"number":7,"verse":"Someone might argue, “If my falsehood enhances God’s truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?”"},{"number":8,"verse":"Why not say - as some slanderously claim that we say - “Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is just!"},{"number":9,"verse":"(No One Is Righteous) What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all!
