We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness."},{"number":10,"verse":"Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!"},{"number":11,"verse":"And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised.
