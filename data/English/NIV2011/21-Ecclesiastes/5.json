Therefore fear God."},{"number":8,"verse":"(Riches Are Meaningless) If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still."},{"number":9,"verse":"The increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields."},{"number":10,"verse":"Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income.
