A person’s wisdom brightens their face and changes its hard appearance."},{"number":2,"verse":"(Obey the King) Obey the king’s command, I say, because you took an oath before God."},{"number":3,"verse":"Do not be in a hurry to leave the king’s presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases."},{"number":4,"verse":"Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to him, “What are you doing?”"},{"number":5,"verse":"Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm, and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure."},{"number":6,"verse":"For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a person may be weighed down by misery."},{"number":7,"verse":"Since no one knows the future, who can tell someone else what is to come?"},{"number":8,"verse":"As no one has power over the wind to contain it, so no one has power over the time of their death.

This too, I say, is meaningless."},{"number":15,"verse":"So I commend the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun."},{"number":16,"verse":"When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth - people getting no sleep day or night -"},{"number":17,"verse":"then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it."}]}
