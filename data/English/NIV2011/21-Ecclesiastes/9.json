As it is with the good, so with the sinful; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them."},{"number":3,"verse":"This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead."},{"number":4,"verse":"Anyone who is among the living has hope - even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!"},{"number":5,"verse":"For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even their name is forgotten."},{"number":6,"verse":"Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun."},{"number":7,"verse":"Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do."},{"number":8,"verse":"Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil."},{"number":9,"verse":"Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun - all your meaningless days.

And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it."},{"number":15,"verse":"Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man."},{"number":16,"verse":"So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” But the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded."},{"number":17,"verse":"The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools."},{"number":18,"verse":"Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good."}]}
