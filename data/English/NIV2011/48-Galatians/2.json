I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain."},{"number":3,"verse":"Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek."},{"number":4,"verse":"This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves."},{"number":5,"verse":"We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you."},{"number":6,"verse":"As for those who were held in high esteem - whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism - they added nothing to my message."},{"number":7,"verse":"On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised."},{"number":8,"verse":"For God, who was at work in Peter as an apostle to the circumcised, was also at work in me as an apostle to the Gentiles."},{"number":9,"verse":"James, Cephas and John, those esteemed as pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me.
