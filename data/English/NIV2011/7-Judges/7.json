The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh."},{"number":2,"verse":"The LORD said to Gideon, “You have too many men.

Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore."},{"number":13,"verse":"Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. “I had a dream,” he was saying. “A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.”"},{"number":14,"verse":"His friend responded, “This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.”"},{"number":15,"verse":"When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down and worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, “Get up! The LORD has given the Midianite camp into your hands.”"},{"number":16,"verse":"Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside."},{"number":17,"verse":"“Watch me,” he told them. “Follow my lead.

They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan."}]}
