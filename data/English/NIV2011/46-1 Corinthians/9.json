Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord?"},{"number":2,"verse":"Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."},{"number":3,"verse":"This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me."},{"number":4,"verse":"Don’t we have the right to food and drink?"},{"number":5,"verse":"Don’t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas ?"},{"number":6,"verse":"Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living?"},{"number":7,"verse":"Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk?"},{"number":8,"verse":"Do I say this merely on human authority? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing?"},{"number":9,"verse":"For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it about oxen that God is concerned?"},{"number":10,"verse":"Surely he says this for us, doesn’t he?

And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me, for I would rather die than allow anyone to deprive me of this boast."},{"number":16,"verse":"For when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!"},{"number":17,"verse":"If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me."},{"number":18,"verse":"What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the gospel."},{"number":19,"verse":"(Paul’s Use of His Freedom) Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible."},{"number":20,"verse":"To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews.

They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever."},{"number":26,"verse":"Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air."},{"number":27,"verse":"No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize."}]}
